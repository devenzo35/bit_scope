The platform offers 25 major US equities and offering up to $5 million in rewards for users trading US stock tokens.\n\nThe top three most-traded stock futures include:\n\n* Tesla (TSLA): $71.5 million\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): $25.05 million\n* Circle (CRCL): $17.68 million\n\nThe platform now offers 25 major US equities, spanning sectors like technology, semiconductors, finance, aviation, and consumer goods.\n\nWhy is TSLA trades significantly higher than the other 2...? did events around Musk trigger the traffic or just users sighting opportunities?",

Just gentle visuals, lo-fi sounds, and a minimal Rain/Sun indicator that blends market sentiment into something meditative.\n\nIt started as a Discord experiment (fast and chaotic back then), but now it\u2019s being reborn as a stress-free, inclusive app \u2014 visual-first, sound-driven, and designed for burnt-out traders, artists, and anyone who wants to feel peace instead of panic.\n\nIf that sounds like your kind of weird\u2026 I\u2019d love your help testing it before release. \ud83d\udc9b\n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Google Group to get access:\n\ud83d\udc49 https://groups.google.com/g/satoshitesters/\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Test link:\nJoin on the web \ud83d\udc49 https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.porupomoruto.btcrainapp\nJoin on Android \ud83d\udc49 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.porupomoruto.btcrainapp",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m pretty new to all of this and could use a bit of help understanding something. I recently bought a BitBox and transferred some Bitcoin I bought from Bitvavo to it. Now I\u2019ve set up an account with Pocket Bitcoin because I like the idea of doing regular automatic buys that go straight to my wallet.\n\nWhen setting up Pocket, it asks me to enter my extended public key (xpub/zpub). I understand that it\u2019s safe because no one can spend my coins with it, but it still feels strange to share something that lets Pocket see all my future addresses and transactions from that account. Isn\u2019t it actually more private if I just give them one single address instead, so they only ever see that one and not everything else?\n\nA friend told me that having a lot of different addresses could make future transactions more expensive if I ever want to send a big amount, since all the small deposits would have to be combined. That part confused me even more. What do most people actually do here? Is sharing the xpub with Pocket considered normal and safe, or is it smarter to just reuse one address even if that\u2019s bad for on-chain privacy?\n\nWould really appreciate some guidance from more experienced Bitcoiners.",

I think it\u2019s some sort of AI stock predicting site but I\u2019m not sure. He was talking to a guy in Switzerland who is possibly part of the company who was counselling him through weekly for free which I find strange. He\u2019s put a lot of money in and has profited a lot in a short amount of time. The money is now in crypto.com but he is left to figure out how to take that $ out on his own but doesn\u2019t really know the next steps as to how, and is too optimistic to be looking into risks. \n\nApparently it\u2019s in USD and his understanding is that it should be easy to just wire transfer it to him in CAD. \n\nDoes this sound legit? Is it an easy process to take this out of Crypto.com as a Canadian? I know people who have been scammed by third party investment websites so to me this is giving red flags. Does anyone have advice that I could pass along to him or know of any risks involved with taking it out in Canada .  ",

It just\u2026 appeared in the Earth\u2019s crust one day. Mysterious. Suspicious. Then, somehow, kings and empires across the world all decided it was \u201cvaluable.\u201d Coincidence?\n\nAnd get this: governments that once banned private gold ownership now hoard tons of it in secret vaults. Massive mining companies in select countries control most of the global supply, and every time gold prices spike, the timing seems just a little too perfect.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if gold, once a symbol of natural wealth and independence, has been pulled into the very power structures it was supposed to liberate us from.\n\nWhat if that was the plan all along? What if \u201cprecious metal\u201d is just the illusion \u2014 the shiny bait \u2014 while central banks quietly consolidate control behind the scenes?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts \u2014 am I overthinking it, or is there a deeper alchemy game being played here?\n\n/s\n",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been reading a lot of complaints lately about Changelly, and the pattern looks worrying. Many users report that once they try swapping a larger amount, their transaction suddenly goes \u201con hold\u201d and they\u2019re hit with endless KYC requests, ID, selfies, proof of income, wallet screenshots, and more. Even after submitting everything, several people say their funds were never released.\n\n\n\nSome users claim they tracked their coins on-chain and saw them moved to other exchanges like HitBTC while Changelly insisted the funds were still \u201cunder review.\u201d Others noticed the terms of service quietly changing, or the support team asking for new documents each time one set was completed.\n\n\n\nCommon red flags mentioned by users:\n\n\n\n\\- Transactions \u201con hold\u201d without clear reason or timeline\n\n\\- Constantly changing KYC demands\n\n\\- Lack of transparency about fund status\n\n\\- Funds traced to external exchanges\n\n\\- Support giving vague or repetitive replies\n\n\\- TOS updates after disputes begin\n\n\n\nIt might not be an outright scam, but it definitely feels like a system built to stall or trap users with larger amounts. If you plan to use Changelly, especially for big swaps, read the Reddit threads first, there are a lot of warning stories out there.",

Are there any platforms or methods you personally trust for P2P Bitcoin purchases?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate hearing how you handle safety, what guarantees to look for, and any tips to avoid getting scammed.\n\nThanks for sharing your experiences, I think it could help a lot of people trying to buy BTC securely.",

I\u2019m also considering taking on a bit more risk with Solana, maybe investing around $500 right now and holding that long term. I understand it\u2019s on the riskier side though.\n\nIf you had $10K in cash to start with, how would you allocate it? Curious to hear how others would balance between safer, long term options like index funds and more speculative plays like crypto.\n\nEdit; I appreciate all the feedback ive received so far!",

The flash crash we say showed the high level of immediate impact leverage buy can create. It was wild to see some of the swings on the majority of the market other than BTC. I\u2019m definitely seeing as well as everyone else the typical 4 year cycle is broken. It going to be interesting to see how the year plays out as there  are only 72 days until the end of the year ",

After watching more and more crypto videos, I bought a tandem cold wallet. I set up a seed a phrase and the 3 cards that are needed to sign transactions going out of the card. So I sent all the crypto in and it successfully all got there. Sweet? So if I want to just hold forever it will be there, and if I ever want to cash out (I will never trade using the internet on the tandem app EVER, I understand that defeats the whole purpose. But if I want to take small gains, I can send it via the blockchain to strike and then sell it on there. Is it really that simple? Never lose the self phrase. Send to Strike (Kraken or Robinhood for other coins) if I want to cash out and cash out that way? Another thing I was thinking about setting up (If I ever wanted to buy something with crypto, which I don't think I will) is a hot wallet. So I would then transfer whatever the exact amount for the purchase is into the hot wallet from my tandem wallet and buy it using the hot wallet. What if I want to send crypto to somebody how would that work? They just would give me their cold wallet code or QR code and it's that simple? Please give more of anything I am missing. Also one question. I tested sending $5 of bitcoin to strike and when I pressed receive on strike it gave me two options lightning and on the blockchain. I don't know what lightning is. But the whole reason we're in this thing is because of blockchain and believing in it? Does lightning go on the blockchain. Do I just have a public digital wallet code on the blockchain? And nobody can access this without getting my seed phrase, and I guess holding me at gunpoint with both my phone and card?",

I want a device that I can fully trust, with solid security measures and a strong track record.\n\nFor now, I plan to hold only Bitcoin, but I might want to exchange to other coins in the future, so I don\u2019t want a device that\u2019s strictly limited to BTC. I\u2019ve read a lot about Trezor and Ledger, but I\u2019m still unsure which model is the best choice. Many people recommend the Trezor Model T due to its open-source firmware and security features, while others suggest the Ledger Nano X or even the Ledger Stax for their robust build and wide crypto support.\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate hearing about your personal experiences, pros and cons, and any advice for someone buying their first hardware wallet. Which hardware wallet would you choose if your main focus was long-term security, reliability, and peace of mind?",

        "selftext": "Hello Bitcoiners,\n\nHello Michael Saylor (I know you\u2019re reading this \ud83d\udc40),\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard the most poetic phrase in finance:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is digital gold.\u201d\n\n\nRecently, I was scrolling through X and saw videos of people literally lining up outside stores to buy physical gold.\nApparently, that\u2019s where retail went this cycle.\n\nMeanwhile, central banks are hoarding gold like it\u2019s going out of style.\nAnd gold keeps smashing All-Time-High after All-Time-High.\n\nSo\u2026 what does this have to do with Bitcoin?\n\nWell, gold\u2019s total market cap is closing in on $30 TRILLION.\nAnd I believe a massive shift from gold to Bitcoin is coming.\n\nBut - and here\u2019s the twist -\n\nNot for the reasons you\u2019ve heard before.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the classic debate:\n\n\n\ud83e\udd47 The \u201cGold Is Tangible\u201d Argument\n\nThe Peter Schiff crowd always says:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is digital! When I buy gold, I get something real that\u2019s held its value for thousands of years!\u201d\n\n\n\nFair enough. That\u2019s a valid point.\n\nBitcoiners usually fire back with something like:\n\n\u201cYeah, but you have to store and protect it. You can\u2019t move it easily. It\u2019s inefficient.\u201d\n\n\n\nOr, if you really want to bring out the big guns, you go straight to the heart of it:\n\n\u201cGold\u2019s supply isn\u2019t fixed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd that, my friends, is where the real story begins.\n\n\n\n\u2699\ufe0f Gold\u2019s Supply Problem (The Surface Layer)\n\nSure, we all know the basic version of this argument:\n\nNew deposits might be discovered.\n\nMining tech keeps improving.\n\nSupply can increase - which hurts price.\n\n\nThat\u2019s the surface layer.\nBut no one talks about what happens when you take this idea to the extreme.\n\nBecause there might be a LOT more gold out there - in our oceans, deep underground, or even floating in space - waiting to be mined once tech catches up.\n\nSpace mining alone could nuke gold\u2019s scarcity narrative overnight.\n\nBut that\u2019s not even the biggest threat.\n\n\n\n\n\u269b\ufe0f The Quantum FUD Nobody Talks About\n\nEveryone in crypto loves to talk about \u201cquantum FUD\u201d -\nhow quantum computers will break Bitcoin and other cryptos.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nWhat if quantum computers break gold instead?\n\n\n\nStay with me.\n\nQuantum computers and AGIs could make it possible to synthesize gold - atom by atom - in a lab.\n\nYou read that right:\n\nArtificially created gold.\n\n\n\nOnce that happens, gold stops being \u201cscarce.\u201d\nIt becomes - and I say this lovingly - just another fiat currency.\n\nWhen anyone with enough computing power can \u201cprint\u201d gold with no max cap, its store-of-value narrative collapses.\n\nAnd when that happens, where do you think all that value goes?\n\nYep. To Bitcoin aka \"digital gold\"\n\n\nNow, people will say \u201cWhat about Bitcoin? Won\u2019t quantum computers break that too?\u201d\n\nMaybe - nobody knows exactly how this will play out.\nBut here\u2019s the difference:\n\nBitcoin can defend itself. Gold cannot.\n\n\nIf quantum ever becomes a real threat, Bitcoin can adapt, upgrade, evolve.\nGold just sits there \u2014 waiting.\n\nI think quantum computing poses a much bigger long-term threat to gold than to Bitcoin.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t science fiction anymore.\nQuantum research and advanced material engineering are progressing at breakneck speed.\nWe\u2019re not talking about a hundred years from now - we\u2019re talking 15 to 50 years at most before synthetic gold might become technically and economically feasible.\n\nWhen that happens, gold\u2019s entire scarcity narrative could collapse overnight.\nAnd when it does, the capital flight to Bitcoin might be one of the biggest financial shifts in history.\n\nThis might sound far off, but with how fast tech is moving, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this becomes real.\n\nNO FINANCIAL ADVICE.

        "selftext": "The main game theoretical bottleneck for multihop payments has been the \"reserve payment attack\". The historical solution to it, the 2-phase commit, has the problem that an intermediary can get stuck with the full payment as penalty. Ryan Fugger (who pioneered the 2-phase commit in 2005-something) originally suggested a gradual penalty instead (in 2006, and this has now been achieved with the 3-phase commit). Ryan failed to get it to work in practice with the 2-phase commit (and instead suggested \"staggered timeouts\" which is what everyone has used since then), the reason for that being that the 2-phase only has a penalty on one of the phases, and with \"gradual penalty\" the cumulative time until payment fully times out gets very long (potentially many days, instead of a few minutes), and since the timeout was the original solution to \"reserve payment attack\", you now end up with a problem on the phase without a penalty. The solution to that, is to add a penalty on both phases, but to do so is quite hard. You have to recognize that there is two possible 2-phase commits, one that cancels on timeout and one that finishes on timeout. And then, you have to combine them, with an intermediary phase that switches the timeout behaviour. With this, an actually secure \"lightning network\" is possible.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1xtccfjb55wf1.gif\n\n",

I do certainly plan on getting a cold storage wallet, even if it\u2019s bit smaller an amount as who knows where BTC will end up even with a small initial investment and small mining with amounts that, again, I fully know I do have a chance of losing either value or completely losing.\n\nQuestion being, is Coinbase a good and safe place to initially put my purchase into for BTC in these initial times until I get a cold storage wallet as I put that in and slowly mine overtime to hopefully reef the benefit? Or is there a different middle ground app that I should consider entirely? TIA\n\nEDIT: also, any (taken with a grain of salt but to be looked into) tidbits of secrets/help/wisdom is also appreciated. So trust me, one thing I do have down, is the fact that no matter what anybody says, hold hold, motherfucking hold! As well as said several times, nothing going into this is necessarily money that I\u2019m terrified of losing, and even if I don\u2019t become a millionaire, if I have a little bit coming back my way eventually I will ultimately still be happier and better off.

Governments and institutions that once called it \u201cdangerous\u201d are now quietly investing in it. Meanwhile, huge mining operations in certain countries control a massive share of the hash rate, and ETF approvals seem to come right when retail hype spikes.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if Bitcoin, which started as a symbol of financial freedom, is slowly being pulled into the same centralized power structures it was meant to escape.\n\nWhat if that\u2019s been the plan all along?\nWhat if \u201cdecentralization\u201d is just the illusion keeping everyone hooked while institutions quietly consolidate control behind the scenes?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts \u2014 am I overthinking, or is there a deeper game being played here?",

I estimate that Bitcoin's zero date will be seven days after Buffett's passing. In other words, it's unlikely he lived to see it. \n\nGold and Bitcoin will likely pass each other in opposite directions at 6666.66. \n\nThe market has now understood that so-called decentralization is a scam: for example, if you're a drug dealer, transacting with Bitcoin is far more dangerous than with cash, as Bitcoin can easily be targeted and tracked by the NSA/CIA. \n\nI learned this in 2012. At the time, I was working in the security team at a software company. My boss required everyone to report weekly on their learnings from new technologies, and everyone took turns. When it was my turn, I wrote a book report on TOR NETWORK (the core technology of the dark web). \n\nNear the end, my boss asked, \"Is this TOR network a honeypot or a decoy network?\" Yes, the so-called dark web is actually a decoy network, and I agreed with him. \n\nThen, my colleague Ben, from the same group, quietly told me later that he was working on Bitcoin. He added that Bitcoin had recently gone up by two dollars, but he still didn't fully understand the intricacies of the encryption algorithms, much like the dark web's constant tinkering with them. I was obsessed with trading options at the time, and I looked down on Ben for mining Bitcoin, which was only worth around ten dollars. However, like the dark web, Bitcoin is easily traceable, making it a valuable tool for the CIA, FBI, and NSA to ensnare criminal gangs.\"",

You\u2019ve got a chart of Bitcoin monthly returns and you\u2019re eyeing October. From 2013 to 2024, October closed green 10/12 times (only 2014 and 2018 were red).

It feels amazing to finally share this with my family after keeping it quiet for so long.\n\nNow I\u2019m trying to figure out the best way to balance things a bit. I\u2019d like to move part of my BTC into something more stable for now, but I\u2019d prefer to avoid big centralized platforms if possible. I\u2019m wondering if anyone here has experience using peer-to-peer options or privacy-friendly setups that still feel safe and reliable.\n\nWould really appreciate any insights or personal experiences from others who\u2019ve done something similar.",

Stop trying to time the market every time it's swinging up and down. \n\nWhen you have extra cash you don't need, that's your crypto money. \n\nDo you make huge gains? No, but I've put in 700 total over the last decade and am now upper mid 4 figures... Just by leaving it there. It's like an ant farm that might buy me a vacation someday instead of just another gambling app. \n\nThe only management I do is turn half into cash when my portfolio doubles to put back in when things cool off. I've stepped on profits majorly once, and saved profits majorly once by doing that, but either way neither time was remotely stressful. ",

        "selftext": "Finally the long overdue day arrives tomorrow when general brokerage accounts (of at least a few brokers) will provide access to bitcoin and ethereum backed etps and allow a safe tradfi route for those who were so far too much on the fence. Not only does this open the route to tax wrappers (sipp / isa) but also provides one of the safest ways to gain exposure if you didn't want to go down the 'control your own keys' route. \n\nI know that at least 21shares and Wisdomtree btc and eth etps are set to be opened for trading to Retail tomorrow with the rest soon following within days. \n\nTo start with, access will be provided by Interactive Investors, Trading212 and Saxobank with others likely to follow in due course. \n\nWhile there has been concern that these products are etns rather than US style etfs, such risks are largely overblown as the products are nonetheless fully backed\n\nhttps://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/crypto_etn_admission_factsheet.pdf\n\nThe reason for Europe and UK using this structure is down to UCITS regulation not allowing etfs with single or concentrated asset underlyings. \n\nEdit 20/10: Can confirm that I tried in Interactive Investor this morning 20/10 and orders in CBTC were going through. \nT212 strangely gave me a message saying my 24 hour cooling off period was still underway and that i would be able to trade after 30/10.\n\nEdit: T212 now works for me and access to crypto etps is working!\n\nEdit: II is also providing access to Bitwise issued etps on LSE. Of particular note here is ticker ET33. This is far and away the most compelling staked Ethereum etp. Charges 0.65% pa fee and gives you all the staking yield minus 10% staking fee. It's benchmarked to an external Ethereum Total Return Index\n\nhttps://bitwiseinvestments.eu/de/products/bitwise-ethereum-staking-etp/\n\nDon't be confused. ET33 is just the GBP ticker of the above. \n\nEdit: Another BTC etp worth looking into. Ticker BTC3 (Bitwise Core Bitcoin etp)\nFee: 0.05% until 31/3/2026 and then reverting to 0.2%\n\nEdit: And finally Blackrock joining the party too with IB1T (note this is not the US IBIT). It's an etp like all others in UK. 0.15% to start with and reverting to 0.25% later. Somewhat higher fees but might appeal to anyone paranoid about issuer default risk. \n",

Nobody ever knows about short term price fluctuations, stop trying to figure that out.\n\nDCA frees the soul, should do that, or hold what you\u2019ve bought so far for several years at least.  If you\u2019re expecting short term results of any sort, you\u2019re simply gambling, and so would probably be better off with something that wouldn\u2019t cause you to think in such a way.",

        "selftext": "So i got my vault seed written down ages ago. With time I totally forgot about it, as I added it to metamask.\n\nLong story short, metamask crashed, i managed to recover other accounts with their keys ... and one of those keys have barely visible words, because that damn ink sunfaded so bad i cant read it.\n\nI managed to get most words using self made image processing algorithms, but three of them are really damaged. I thought i could extract the words as some forms lead to some letters, but I still cant get them right. thee reddit app keeps saying it is not valid.\n\nIs there some open source software that could help \"brute forcing\" those 3 words ? I heard it used to work with 1 missing, but maybe 3 is too much.  and i'd rather not spend my sunday coding that, i spent enough time on it.\n\nThere is not much on the wallet, but i'd like to transfer whatever is on it on another wallet, as I saw the vault gets discontinued.\n\n**I got it ! Ended up shining a strong light through the paper and i could finally detect the 2 missing words after guessing the first. Thank you all for your suggestions !**\n\n**If you are ever in a similar situation:**\n\n**1/  shining a strong light helps a lot outlining whatever was left**\n\n**2/  Shining UV is also worth a shot - not too long as it may destroy the remaninging ink and paper.**\n\n**Take a picture, then either manually push contrast to the max, or alternate opening and closing morphological transformations until you can read the text( applying those amplifies contours, which is  what letters are)**",

ETF's holders dont even know how to send a P2P transaction and altcoins have been on a decline since the last bullmarket. \n\nThe only hope people had was when Trump pushed it up higher end 2024, but most people here failed to see the intent behind it. Its to grift and for personal gain, not to improve the concept. Ever wonder why Trump liked bitcoin so much all of a sudden? Almost as if he is preparing with family to have an exit plan for when stuff turns sour. Hard to lug gold over the border in big numbers, very easy to walk Bitcoin over. Ooh yeah and did we talk about the bribes that are so easily done now?\n\nIts all just turned into a grift and this community included embraced it. Now you get to watch how the crypto-king once again grifts people out of their life savings. The dude has been made fun of by Americans for decades, he hates them. This is his vindication to show the world he is actually \"capable\"",

        "selftext": "I started dabbling in crypto somewhere around 2022 onwards.\n\nI had seen the meteoric run in alts during 2020-2021 where memecoins minted actual billionaires and some of the alts were the easiest 100x in the history of humanity. I observed all the action but stayed away as I was in Uni and didn't have enough money to dabble in crypto.\n\nWhen the fed raised interest rates in 2022 and bitcoin as well as altcoins started collapsing, I entered the market. This was also when FTX went bust. I was sure that this downturn would not last long and people who would invest in alts would be blessed with 100x or at the very least 10x.\n\nI was dead wrong, alts have never recovered post 2022 crash. Almost all of them are dead and underperform in comparison to bitcoin by a long margin. If bitcoin crashes 5%, most alts crashed 50% and if bitcoin rises 5%, alts rise 10% at best. The\u00a0R:R\u00a0was severely skewed against alts.\n\nFrom 2022-2025, I dabbled in a lot of alt coins and memecoins and have lost crazy amounts of money. Had i just accumulated bitcoin instead, I would be up 5X today on my overall investment in crypto instead of the -96% I am at right now. I never used leverage and didn't do options either. I guess the liquidity that exited the market with the FTX collapse never came back. This meant almost all the altcoins were just dead and had no fresh bidding.\n\nThe flash crash on account trump threatening tariffs on China was an eye opener. So many alts nuked 50%+ overnight and some even went to 0 almost. This finally opened my eye and made me realize that the altcoin market is done forever. There is no organic bid for 99% of altcoins in the market. Just a bunch of market makers and CEXs trading between themselves coupled with some MEV bots.\n\nI took whatever remaining amount I had post the China tariff flash crash and converted it to bitcoin, going ahead, I am just going to DCA into bitcoin and hold it in a cold wallet.\n\nWhen I first entered crypto, many folks told me to stay away from altcoins and just accumulate bitcoin but I guess some lessons are just learnt the hard way.\n\nEdit - If you wanna make money off of alts in crypto, the only way is by being glued to crypto twitter (reddit crypto subs are basically useless to identify alts which might moon) and then jumping from one hot narrative in crypto twitter to another. So recently perp dexes were a huge narrative in crypto twitter. After perp dexes, BSC memecoins were mooning, so you need to buy the right memecoin and exit at the right time else again you roundtrip all your gains.\n\nThe whole alt market right now is just ensuring your ape into a narrative before it moons and hope that the price actually moons AND also book profits at the right time else you round-trip all your gains. Very impossible for the average person to do this.\n\nEdit 2- You cannot make money off of altcoins, bitcoin DCA with no leverage is the only way.",

The game currently supports around 200 biggest crypto pairs.\n\nHow it works:\n\n* You\u2019re given a random asset (crypto or stock) and cutoff date.\n* You place a trade with optional stop loss & take profit.\n* You fast-forward the chart until the outcome is reached.\n\nNo login or signup required to use the site.

He asks me how much Bitcoin is now. I tell him it\u2019s dropped a bit but hovering around $113,000. He says, \u201c.113,000?\u201d With a decimal in the front. I chuckled and said, \u201cno, one hundred and thirteen thousand dollars.\u201d The guys face said it all.

I don\u2019t like to leave Bitcoin at ignition so I was sending it every few days to Robinhood. Also sending from Robinhood to Ignition frequently. I didn\u2019t know this was not allowed (I look like a money launderer) so they disabled my ability to send or receive crypto. This last missing transfer from Ignition to Robinhood was received but stuck in the validation process. Then they refused it, and say they sent it back. Provided me a hash, tho no where on my acct does it say sent to X. \nIgnition has no record of it. \n\nThat is where it\u2019s \u2018stuck\u2019. I am aware it\u2019s not really lost. \n\n\nI believe a few people are following my conversation w Charming-Doubt, \nWell they seem to have disappeared. \n\nSo if anyone can HELP ME, pls do. \nFirst I now have a personal wallet. \nChanged to a better exchange. \nAnd have synched everything up. \n\nBut my lost bitcoin is still\u2026well, \u2018lost\u2019. \n\nThis was my follow up w Charming, but they\u2019ve disappeared and I cannot post a reply. \nSo I\u2019m asking for help. \n\n\n^So just finished a long chat w ignition,\na most helpful fellow named Andres\u2026\nI sent him the info you suggested,\nAs well as your script of what I should say. \nI asked if I had provided all the info as you wrote. \nI had. \nI also provided the hash. \n\nThey show no attempts at any transactions,\nAnd the transaction id did not show in their system - anywhere. \nNor was there any attempts made for returns to my acct. \nThe last they see the hash was being sent out. \nThey said what usually happens in these situations is they get sent back the transaction and then they just cancel the send. And it would be back in my acct. \n\nThe transaction id does not register in their system at all to any accts. \n\nThe hash continues to show up as \u2018no results found\u2019 when I search for it. \n\nOn Robinhood I see nothing on my acct as returned or denied or however it would be worded.

I\u2019ve set myself up with a hardware wallet and I\u2019m gonna just DCA and HODL, small bit every week, just for some fun and to see what happens. Anyone have any advice or stuff I should know moving forward? Thanks! (I\u2019ll be investing in nothing else btw, I\u2019m not gonna get too into crypto cuz I\u2019ll just get obsessed and lose money, solely BTC over a long horizon, it\u2019ll be 10+ years minimum) ",

        "selftext": "If one ask whether Bitcoin has become money (medium of exchange) in the sense originally intended, the answer is most likely no. Store of value? Partly.\n\nThe very fact that the price of cryptocurrency is still measured in USD and is perceived as such, rather than in its own internal unit of value suggests no autonomous market of goods and services outside the fiat system has emerged.\n\nMost users interact with crypto through centralized regulated exchanges, which effectively kills the idea of private economy.\n\nAs a projection of Austrian ideas, cryptocurrency has not achieved its purpose.\n\nRather than becoming an alternative, it has integrated into the traditional financial system and evolved into another speculative asset subject to credit/monetary cycles. Add to that the high transaction costs and the inefficiency of Bitcoin itself, and it becomes clear that a market not supported by a real goods and services will reproduce the very crisis it sought to escape.\n\nThere are too many people concerned whether bitcoin will hit million in a year or two, while few consider that it might just as well collapse to zero.\n\nThe foundation is there,  hopefully the next attempt will be more successful.",

        "selftext": "Hope you survived last friday. Another proof that you shouldn't gamble on perps more then you're willing to loose.   \nAnd its just that - gambling. Not investing. Just placing occasional one direction bets.   \nIt\u2019s been exactly 7 days since the biggest crypto liquidation ever - $19 billion wiped in a few hours. Everyone was overleveraged on HP, Aster, other dexs. I guess if i was the biggest cex by volume, i would also use my own books to price assets instead of relaying on some 3rd party. Loss of speed is main concern, but history gave us different lesson.\n\nNow the question is, was that *the flush* or just the beginning? After all, we're between 2 interest cut rates...\n\nBTC dropped hard but still holding the range. Around 108k down to 106k is where things got ugly. If we drop under 100k, next stops are like 98\u201394k. I personally don\u2019t see it staying below that long. Weekly close above 100k keeps us safe. Below = probably panic zone.\n\nETH actually looks stronger, still chilling around 3.8k. As long as it closes above that, range intact. Below that, 2.8k is next. SOL also holding like a champ around 84\u201389, even after four red days.\n\nEveryone\u2019s doomposting right now. Fear and greed Index is deep in *fear*, not extreme fear yet, but close. That\u2019s usually when the best entries happen. I\u2019m not saying ape in, but historically this is where smart money starts scaling in.\n\n[2 clear moments to buy and 2 to sell.

That\u2019s good. Liquidity drives everything. More liquidity \u2192 higher risk appetite \u2192 higher BTC\n\n[blue is the global liq index](https://preview.redd.it/wvcz81g4byvf1.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=bde6cbd30a63695f00c61e4e8242a27122b19f1d)\n\nGold\u2019s at ATH, institutions aren\u2019t selling BTC, and Trump\u2019s probably pushing rate cuts again. Feels like sentiment is way more bearish than fundamentals.\n\nIf BTC does sweep 95\u201398k, I think it\u2019s a shakeout before another bounce.

        "selftext": "Hello, I'm currently using a Trezor One, pretty happy with it, but wondering if I should change it. It has some flaws that would like to talk with you:\n\n-The passphrase must be entered using the PC keyboard. This is my main concern and probably the reason I'll change it. I don't think is a huge risk because an atacker would need to have my PC compromised and also access to my 24 words. But still, maybe i should change it \n\n- Not airgaped. Don't think is very important. Sure, the cable is a theorical vector of atack, but a very difficult one if I'm not mistaken.\n\n- Not safe chip. If someone gets physical access to my device could hack it. To my understanding this is still very difficult, only top hackers could do it. He would need also the passphrase, but given that is typed in the PC, I assume it would be easy for him to obtain.\n\n- No protection against nonce atack like Dark Skippy. Only a couple of HW have specific protocol against those atacks. If I'm not wrong, the firmware of my device must be compromissed. If Trezor suit checks that firmware and is ok, I should not worry, right?\n\nSo, with a Trezor safe 3 I would fix the passphrase and the safe chip things. I have also took a look at cold card Q. I like the extra security the airgaped QR signing process give, and also, it looks cyberpunk an cool. But Im not sure if that coolness and extra security worth the high price.\n\nThanks in advance for your opinions and advice.",

If you DCA as the value of Bitcoin goes up, you are paying higher and higher prices for it. As someone who bought at the peak of 2021 (didn't sell) this has been a difficult piece of information to internalize. I ran this experiment with GPT-5 and got the same result. I have some money in other assets which I want to move to BTC and still find it difficult to pull the trigger on a smash buy.",

No pools, no trust, no shortcuts.\n\nIt took patience and a lot of trial and error, but now everything runs smoothly \u2014 fully independent, fully mine.\n\nI\u2019m not doing it for money. I\u2019m doing it because Bitcoin\u2019s strength depends on individuals like us who decide to verify, not trust.\n\nBig players can hold coins.

Long lines, limited stock, and prices through the roof.\n\nGold had its time \u2014 it\u2019s scarce enough, but it\u2019s also heavy, hard to move, and impossible to audit without trusting someone else. You can\u2019t teleport it, you can\u2019t verify it, and governments can seize it anytime they want.\n\nBitcoin fixes all that. It\u2019s scarce by code \u2014 21 million, auditable by anyone, portable across borders, divisible to eight decimals, and impossible to counterfeit. I don\u2019t need permission to hold it, move it, or verify it.\n\nSo while people are standing in line hoping to get a few grams of metal, I\u2019m on my couch stacking sats \u2014 watching Netflix, holding the hardest money humanity\u2019s ever created.\n\nThe digital gold doesn\u2019t need a jewelry store.",

        "selftext": "\nIt\u2019s been a week since I\u2019ve been trying to snap back into reality, I\u2019m a 26 year old male still living with his mom the main reason I\u2019ve decided to live with her another year was to have more capital to accumulate more assets like BTC and invest into real estate partnerships (rentals)\n\nLast week my girl left me and it hit me, I thought I had it all planned out and she knew about my vision and would always say she was on board, my plan was to get duplex and move in with her on one side, rent the other in the year of 2026/2027 and to get to one full btc in the next 3 years I\u2019m currently sitting at 0.36 btc and I make about 60k a year I also have 2 rental properties with partners already with 2k cash for emergencies. I have about 10k in debt. I know I could be doing better I recently got rid of nice car I was paying off to get a cheaper one that I can buy upfront so that was a downgrade. Then she left me without no explanation. I know the problem was the fact that I never invested to much money into our relationship but I always gave her time which to me was more valuable. The main reason I never spent to much money into our relationship was because our first year together she cheated. I felt like the risk to reward ratio just wasn\u2019t in my favor after that however we were together for 4years. Her mom always expected me to take her out but I had the tough choice of spending more money into my ex or putting it into btc. I chose BTC and today I feel like I\u2019m paying the price for my decision. I fear that now I will struggle to meet new women in a timely manner to have a kid. What could I have done wrong and what should I not do in my next relationship \n\n(Original post was deleted)",

Effectively a tax free income without selling the bitcoin.\nI've been having a play around with a few different models. Some are really bullish and look like I'll be living on a private yacht in Monaco, and some are really conservative like this one.\n\nIt's a 20 year retirement plan starting in 2030. \nI've used 1 Bitcoin to keep it simple and assumed a 25% cagr from where we are today. So in 2030 it assumes bitcoin is at \u00a3204,711. The loan to value scales up to peak at 20% at 12% interest so the first loan is for \u00a314,331 plus interest. Each year I've borrowed 3% more to keep inline with official inflation in the UK. It's doesn't sound like a huge amount of money but it's tax free and would like cover most people's bills, rent and shopping. \nThis model leaves a ridiculous amount of wiggle room. It assumes bitcoin will be worth over 17 million by 2049 and my loan will only be 1.4 million. Probably way too bullish. I'm guessing that would make the market cap of bitcoin 350 trillion +\nMy math probably isn't mathing but it's a fun exercise. I've never really understood how it works to borrow and live off bitcoin without selling any of the bitcoin or make any payments. But now I feel like i get it. Even if my numbers are off. Or maybe I don't  get it. I'll await the onslaught \ud83d\ude06\nHas anyone else had a play with bitcoin retirement models? Any tips to improve what I'm doing? Or should I just quit all together? \ud83e\udd23",

        "selftext": "Step 1: Create a Crypto Treasury Company and Raise capital -> Step 2: Use that money to buy Crypto -> Step 3: boast about your valuation to raise more capital -> go back to step 2.\n\nEveryone in this sub is probably very familiar with Michael Saylor and Microstrategy and the fact that he's converted Microstrategy into the most well known Crypto Treasury Company who is always buying the BTC top. (currently holding 3% of the BTC supply from \\~5 years of buying)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45stntw0kwvf1.png?width=1406&format=png&auto=webp&s=12b44e16b36a32574a91b80b0f8bbee6a7be40a7\n\nBut unless you either lost money in the .com bubble or you've been following Crypto for a long time, you probably don't know that Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy were accused of Fraud in 2000 for an accounting scandal.\n\n    On March 20, 2000, MicroStrategy announced that it \n    intended to restate its financial results for the \n    fiscal years 1998 and 1999.  MicroStrategy stock, \n    which had recently reached a high of $333 per share... \n    By April 13, 2000, after MicroStrategy announced \n    that it would also restate its fiscal 1997 financial \n    results, the company's stock closed at $33 per share.  \n    The company's restatement reduced revenues over the \n    three-year period by approximately $66 million of \n    the $365 million reported. Approximately $54 million, \n    or 80 percent, of these restated revenues were in 1999.\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2000-186.txt#:~:text=FOR%20IMMEDIATE%20RELEASE%202000%2D186,for%20reporting%20and%20recordkeeping%20violations)\n\nIn the last few years there has been a rise in Crypto Treasury Companies who follow the steps outline above to buy everything from Dogecoin and CRO to BTC and ETH.\n\nWhen the custodied asset is pumping these people obviously \"look smart\" and can raise money to buy more of that treasury asset based off the increased valuation of their treasury assets further boosting the value of their treasury asset. But what happens when the treasury asset nukes in value do the trad-fi investors just eat the loss? Assumedly these companies would have to sell the treasury asset to repay antsy trad-fi investors creating further downward pressure on their and other crypto treasury companies holdings.\n\n# Alts\n\nObviously this scenario would be extremely concerning for treasury companies focusing on alts which might have limited liquidity (see the recent flash crash against all alts last week). So I think at the very least we have to accept that crypto treasury companies for alts, create a huge risk of a blackswan in the future for those alts if treasury companies are forced to liquidate their position. But what about the \"blue chips\"?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ep0kofpigwvf1.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b99886e4455e990fd17e71254b3d2dba85d160\n\n# BTC / ETH\n\nBTC and ETH arguably have a lot more liquidity and can handle a lot more downward pressure especially as BTC and ETH have experienced increased institutional adoption and buying pressure. But with Saylor buying every top (currently holding about 3% of all BTC) and the recent rise of ETH treasury companies. Could either drop enough that treasury companies would be forced to sell causing cascading losses across the entire crypto industry?\n\n\\------\n\nI don't know the answer, I'm sure some people here are very familiar with the topic and could answer that. But what if Crypto Treasury Companies being forced to liquidate is the investment bubble that no is talking about?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been trying to figure out the best way to move from ETH to SOL without using any big centralized exchanges. I know there are bridges and crosschain tools out there, but it\u2019s hard to tell which ones are still active and safe to use right now. Some of the older ones people used to talk about don\u2019t seem very reliable anymore.\n\nWhat I\u2019m really looking for is something that works smoothly, doesn\u2019t require unnecessary verification, and keeps everything simple. I don\u2019t mind if it takes a bit more time, I just want to make sure the process is secure and that the funds actually arrive on the Solana side without issues.\n\nIf anyone here has done an ETH to SOL move recently, I\u2019d really appreciate hearing about your experience, which tools you used, how long it took, and whether it went smoothly. I think a lot of people would find it helpful to know what\u2019s still working well in 2025.\n\n**Update:**\u00a0After trying a few platforms, I finally found one that works \u2013\u00a0**Malgo\u2019s-P2P(MalgoSwap.org)**\u00a0market. Super high liquidity and very low fees.",

        "selftext": "The market is being pushed into a risk-on posture by the Fed, but the catalyst is not strength, it's structural weakness. The central bank was forced to act based on data that proves the economy's structural weakness is far deeper than anyone believed.\n\n1) The Payroll Shock: The Fed's recent dovish pivot was preceded by a historic downward revision of 911,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, the largest adjustment ever recorded. This confirms the labor market is structurally cooling.\n\n2) The Rising Unemployment: The US unemployment rate recently rose to 4.3%. This cooling is not evenly distributed, with unemployment among Black workers jumping to 7.5%, a 25% increase since May 2025.\n\n3) The BTC Liquidity Anchor: This monetary uncertainty is fueling institutional flow into BTC. U.S. crypto ETFs recently set a new inflow record, accumulating $12.8 billion in one month. This sustained demand supports BTC's price floor against policy risk.\n\nDoes the combination of the 4.3% unemployment rate and the policy shift to employment concerns create an irreversible demand for BTC as a macro hedge, or is the persistent consumer confidence hit the true structural weakness that will eventually drag all risk assets down?",

        "selftext": "My background is in market risk modeling, which feeds into capital allocation for a Tier 1 investment bank. I cover multiple asset classes, including Commodities and Equities \u2014 though not Bitcoin, as it\u2019s excluded under current bank capital model rules.\n\nRather than share random TA charts, I\u2019ll provide some qualitative observations on gold, silver, and equities, and how they affect crypto.\n\nGold\n\nGold is clearly in a euphoric phase.\nIts momentum began in late 2021 as central banks raised rates to counter post-COVID inflation. The 2022 Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict added further tailwinds through capital flight, supply shocks, and macro uncertainty.\n\nThe current euphoria is driven largely by speculators exploiting the \u201cexchange-for-physical\u201d basis between London and New York markets (a classic late-cycle behavior). Retail interest has followed. I expect this phase to last only a few more months before a sharp correction.\n\nSilver\n\nSpeculators have since rotated into silver, which shows a similar exchange-for-physical dynamic. Silver\u2019s practical utility adds to its short-term appeal, but this too is likely temporary (perhaps three months) before normalization.\n\nImplications for Crypto\nGold and silver, being less volatile, currently offer better risk-adjusted returns than Bitcoin. From an investor\u2019s perspective: why take on higher risk for lower return? This dynamic has weighed on crypto.\n\nHowever, as both metals approach their peaks, their relative appeal will fade likely leading to capital rotation into Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\n\nEquities and the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d tech stocks have driven equity markets to euphoric highs, inflating index performance. Index investors benefit from this diversification, but it masks underlying weakness in the broader market.\n\nStrip out these seven names, and U.S. equities look far more reasonable \u2014 at which point, crypto begins to offer more attractive risk-reward. I believe institutions are already trimming exposure, though retail remains caught up in the hype. A correction seems likely within 3\u20136 months.\n\nOutlook for Crypto\n\nThe crypto bull market isn\u2019t over \u2014 but we\u2019re likely in a sideways phase for the next few months as broader markets unwind. The bottom for BTC is in. These are conditions I\u2019d consider accumulation opportunities. I doubt we\u2019ll see Bitcoin at current levels once this rotation plays out.\n\nThat said, macro conditions don\u2019t yet support a sustained bull market many are hoping for. So the eventual peak may be brief.",

        "selftext": "I am not trying to spread fear, but having rode the euphoria in 2021 and the battle scars from surviving the previous bear market in 2022, I still think the 4 year cycle is alive and doing its thing. Not saying that it will 100% happen, but if this month were the cycle peak then the bear market bottom should be November 2026, plus or minus a month compared to the 2022 bear market. Also $30,000 might be unlikely, but hey, in the last bear market everybody thought $30k was the bottom until it crashed another 50% to $15,000. \n\nBack to what I was talking about. If that happens I will literally own a whole coin (and another half a coin for good measures). What are you guys planning to do? This question is directed at both the OG HODLERs who survived the 2022 bear market, or the even more brutal 2018 bear market as well as the new Bitcoiners who entered this year.",

Buying and entering the market seems very complicated, not because you can't enter but how do you ever extract value in some currency that you can spend at some point?\n\n  \nI understand the value is a market that goes up and up.  Why should I not just buy Tesla instead?\n\n  \nI wanna understand this market. I've read a bit about it, but I'm very confused because it does not make sense to me as somebody who has worked in finance for 25 years at hedge funds that were the biggest ones at the time but I'm realistic and rational.\n\n  \nIt just seems like the Tesla merry-go-round that I can already buy.  Or I'm trying to filter money to differ countries that are unstable or buying things I should not be doing.\n\n  \nPlease, somebody with a rational financial background, explain to me this market, how to enter it and more importantly how to exit it in a currency that makes a difference. \n\n  \nThank you in advance\n\n  \n\n\n  \n",

I understand people say comparing its value to fiat defeats the whole purpose of owning Bitcoin, but isn\u2019t this banking on Bitcoin becoming heavily integrated into everyday payments and asset prices like houses.\n\nIf people are just holding Bitcoin as a long term store of value and a way to beat inflation like gold, isn\u2019t it important to compare its value to fiat since you won\u2019t be able to buy anything in Bitcoin?\n\nBasically what I\u2019m asking is are most people on this sub banking on Bitcoin one day being used as a widely accepted payment option, and if not why are you against pricing it in terms of fiat?\n\nAgain I\u2019m new and want to be educated, cheers",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been looking into different ways people are handling Monero lately and was wondering which peer-to-peer platforms are still working well. It seems like some older ones have slowed down or disappeared, and it\u2019s getting harder to tell what\u2019s active or trusted now.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to promote anything, just curious what the community here is using or watching in 2025. It would be great to hear from anyone who\u2019s had recent experience with P2P setups for XMR , what feels smooth and safe, and what\u2019s worth avoiding.\n\nAppreciate any insights or personal feedback.\n\n**Update:** After trying a few platforms, I finally found one that works \u2013 **Malgo\u2019s-P2P(MalgoSwap.org)** market. Super high liquidity and very low fees.",

Also note the Fed chair\u2019s current term ends in May 2026 (bye bye Powell), any leadership change or policy reset could be a macro swing factor.\n\nTreat the sequence ,gold first, BTC later, and the risk bands as a map, not a stopwatch. Watch the liquidity tone (easier vs tighter), DCA in when risk is cooler, DCA out when it runs hot, and skip the urge to call exact tops. Based on my risk metric, BTC $106K = risk 48. If it\u2019s still under 50 this Sunday, I\u2019ll DCA in, sticking to my plan.",

Is it simply because it disrespects Bitcoin?\n\nThis is going to sound very stupid:\n\nThe basic value of Bitcoin lies in the fact that there can never be more than 26 million (I don't remember the actual amount). This is backed by a very secure network that is backed by ever-increasly difficult math problems (this is why I sound stupid, I've never dug deep into this).\n\nYou can also transfer these Bitcoins to other people, making it a tool to facilitate transactions electronically. This is where some type of public general ledger comes in which I'm guessing helps add verification and security to the whole process? (Again, never really dug deep)\n\nAssuming this is all correct, doesn't that make Bitcoin just a very secure, limited edition NFT?",

As you can see, since this cycle has been slower and the gains far less exaggerated on a percentage basis, it looks like it's now the 50 week EMA, or exponential moving average if you're new to all this. If we trade under this for a while, then I'll believe the guys saying \"the bear market has begun.\" I still won't give a rat's ass because I DCA and have no plans of stopping. In fact, I like to double my DCA once BTC drops by 40% or more. I've been in BTC since 2017, and the one thing I know for sure about it, is that it always likes to surprise. It's going to keep doing things for the first time because it's still a relatively young asset. In other words, you can always expect the unexpected. I love BTC because it's helped me achieve most of my financial goals, but only because I've kept a long term perspective, and I believe that this asset will trade for over a million dollars in my lifetime. I can't predict when that will happen, but I know if I just keep stacking a little every day, I'll be better positioned for when it does than if I try to trade it and end up losing sats. I figured I'd share my thoughts since a lot of the posts I've seen on this sub have been doom posts about small drops in the price, and the massive liquidation event last week that wiped out all the leveraged guys. Be well my fellow humans and keep the faith, your patience will be rewarded eventually. ",

Winning turns fear into courage, losing turns courage into impatience, and the line between both is thinner than most people think.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to FOMO when you see everyone talking about a coin and the chart is nothing but green. At first you might resist, but as it keeps going higher, that urge grows until you finally give in. In the end, how you feel about that decision always comes down to how it plays out, either you\u2019re brave for jumping in or foolish for not staying out.

If gold of all things can pull off a move like this quantitatively tight environment with people losing their jobs, then just imagine what Bitcoin will do when (not *if*, *when*) it starts to run again before year\u2019s end. Even better, imagine what Ethereum will do. Ever better still, imagine what the rest of the altcoin market will do.\n\nPeople are gonna take their gold and silver profits and look for new places to parlay them into. What\u2019s the next best thing? \u201cOh, look Bitcoin\u2019s $20k cheaper than it was just two weeks ago\u2026 Ethereum is at a discount compared to early October\u201d",

I\u2019ve been working for about 1.5 years full time. And they have excellent 10% match program.\n\n401k is currently all invested in S&P. I already tried seeing if they had btc options available at all and through brokerage link but no luck. Otherwise that\u2019s what I would have done. \n\nWith 60 month time frame I would only be missing out on 55$ every 2 weeks. \n\nMiner cost $6141\nMonthly electricity/ hosting $143 \n\nI have an LLC set up so these costs would be tax deductible. \n\nI still plan to contribute 10% on top of the loan. What are your opinions? I made a change of plans since my previous post, thanks!!\n",

When the Fed pivots easier means rate cuts, ending QT, adding liquidity, fear cools and money rotates into risk assets. That\u2019s when Bitcoin tends to run, usually after a lag.\n\nI\u2019m not listing the 2017 cycle because gold didn\u2019t break a new ATH then, and the monetary policy environment was different.\n\n2011 cycle (tight to easier, money tap ON):\n\n* Tight backdrop eased (low rate guidance + Operation Twist).\n* Gold broke ATH and topped first (Aug 2011).\n* Bitcoin followed \\~833 days later (Dec 2013 cycle top) as liquidity seeped into risk.\n\n2020 cycle (shock to max easy, money tap ON):\n\n* Panic, then zero rates + big QE (very easy).\n* Gold broke ATH and topped first (Aug 2020).\n* Bitcoin followed \\~469 days later (Nov 2021 cycle top) as risk appetite returned.\n* Lag shrank: 833 to 469 days.\n\n2025 Money tap ON (turning up):\n\n* We\u2019ve moved from the 2022-25 tight phase (hikes/QT) toward easier (rate cuts, the Fed just announced QT is ending).\n* shrank pace: 469 / (833/469) = 469/1.78 = 264 days.\n* If lags keep compressing at a similar pace, use \\~260 days as a yardstick (not a prediction) for how quickly BTC could follow gold in an easier money environment, pointing to a mid 2026 window. Also note the Fed chair\u2019s current term ends in May 2026 (bye bye Powell), any leadership change or policy reset could be a macro swing factor.\n\nTreat the sequence ,gold first, BTC later, and the risk bands as a map, not a stopwatch. Watch the liquidity tone (easier vs tighter), DCA in when risk is cooler, DCA out when it runs hot, and skip the urge to call exact tops. Based on my risk metric, BTC $106K = risk 48. If it\u2019s still under 50 this Sunday, I\u2019ll DCA in, sticking to my plan.",

Bitcoin is different, it has no physical use, but it\u2019s scarce, secured by a global network, and backed by collective trust. Today real value isn\u2019t just about physical usefulness; it\u2019s a bundle: scarcity + clear rules + durable incentives that keep the network running + real-world touchpoints like custody, settlement, and tokenized cash flows. On top of that, digital assets add programmability, the ability to create automated payments or financial tools on top of the base asset. ",

        "selftext": "Gold is up roughly 1600% from the low in 1999 when  the Bank of England  dump 390 tons of gold in the market (low was approximately 250-260 per ounce). As far as I\u2019m concerned bitcoin in the same time frame going forward is a much better option. It too gold that it took 26  years to go up 1600% from the low of a black swan event. As gold increases in value more money will be put into mining at higher costs increasing the supply. There is only about 5.25% of BTC that can be eventually brought to market maximum. The utility of BTC  to physical gold is how easily it can be used transferred to pay for billion (dollar) transactions between companies and countries. The amount of BTC will decline every year due to errors or unique circumstances. Estimates vary on how much is actually lost (10-20%).. in the next 50 years we should have some definitive answers of how many wallets have remained dormant since 2013 other than the 4.862% Satoshi has presumably locked up forever.

Is there any possibility that it will go up again before the end of the year? I don't plan to have the money invested for 10+ year so don't tell me to buy more lol.

        "title": "AMA with Auki: Building the real world web for robots and AI",
        "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/os4lanrkyovf1.jpg?width=4078&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89a679e39a80ce466e7a180c00d01df7ce0e5997\n\nHi Reddit, this is Tracy from Auki. We like to make the controversial claim that Satoshi\u2019s legacy is not Bitcoin. 100 years from now, what we\u2019ll remember Satoshi for is starting the decentralization movement that made the physical world accessible to AI.\n\nWhy? Because 70% of the world economy is still tied to physical locations and labor, so making the physical world accessible to AI represents a 3X increase in the TAM of AI in general. Spatial computing \u2013 the art of teaching digital devices to understand the real world \u2013 is a prerequisite for the future of robotics, physical AI, and smart cities.\n\nThis is not lost on the tech giants. Last year on Lex Fridman\u2019s podcast, Elon Musk was asked what it would take to win the AI race. He answered that you\u2019ll need two things: the best compute and the best data. He\u2019d already spent $400M on his new \u201cgigafactory of compute,\u201d and for the best data, he\u2019s counting on his Optimus robot to be the largest *source* of data in the world.\u00a0\n\nElon Musk is not alone in this realization. All of the largest tech companies in the world including Google and Meta are pouring billions of dollars into owning this foundational layer of the future of the internet. They are building a massive surveillance apparatus to collect all of the world\u2019s spatial data. Optimus isn\u2019t in our homes yet, but this is already happening with Google Streetview, Meta\u2019s smart glasses, Niantic\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Go, the list goes on. Whoever wins the AI race will be in a position of almost unimaginable power to monitor and modify our very thoughts.\n\nSounds like a nightmare; what can we do about it? Auki is making the physical world accessible to AI by building an open source and decentralized real world web: a way for robots and digital devices like smart glasses and phones to browse, navigate, and search physical locations. Think of it as the inverse of how the world wide web allows us to browse, navigate, and search digital information.\n\nUnlike literally everyone else (including other web3 projects), we don\u2019t collect any of the data. Instead, we allow venue owners to collect and host their own data, so that it\u2019s shared only between the venue and visiting devices/robots without any Big Brother.\n\nAuki's goal is to become the decentralized nervous system of AI in the real world, providing collaborative spatial reasoning for the next 100 billion devices on Earth and beyond.\n\nWe started in 2019 creating shared augmented reality overlays for the tabletop game Warhammer 40k, invented and patented a technique called instant calibration that lets multiple devices calibrate into a shared coordinate system just by scanning a QR code, and raised money in 2021 to build out our collaborative spatial computing protocol for the AR metaverse. Fast forward to today, and that same protocol is used by robots, smart glasses, and AI copilots to understand the real world.\n\nA few 2025 highlights:\n\n* Last month our Unitree G1 humanoid robot, Terri, connected to the real world web domain of WOW Summit and could [autonomously navigate the conference venue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd3j6Tcafkc) despite never having been there before.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd3j6Tcafkc)\n* We've integrated a number of other robots with the real world web too, including those from leading Chinese robotics companies PadBot and Slamtec, and our list of robotics partners is growing rapidly.  \n* [Cactus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en9OcsHvUVg), our spatial AI solution for retail and warehouses, is being deployed in three continents (soon four hopefully!) and proving that AI copilots for physical work are commercially viable. It already brings in 7 digit ARR and our current deal pipeline is over $200M ARR.[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en9OcsHvUVg)\n* Our ecosystem is growing as builders realize they need privacy-preserving spatial awareness: Mentra is building [open source smart glasses](https://x.com/caydengineer/status/1917585371409572305), Zappar is building [app-free navigation for the blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NAbw7KI2xo), Alpha AI is [pioneering the low-altitude economy in Hong Kong with drone inspections and deliveries](https://x.com/AukiNetwork/status/1904562287685304492), Mika is building an [error-detecting AI copilot for physical work](https://x.com/augmentedcamel/status/1976489052896625139), and many more. Watch [State of the Auki Network 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUtqAXM8Srs) for an overview.  \n* We co-founded [Intercognitive](https://www.intercognitive.com/), a foundation for establishing global standards for AI accessibility and interoperability.  \n* Over 12M $AUKI tokens have been burned to pay for network usage, and our community has earned over $1.2M worth of tokens as rewards for running nodes and setting up domains.  \n* TODAY on our [weekly community update](https://x.com/AukiNetwork/status/1979170526284353966) we demoed the world\u2019s first [app agnostic, device agnostic spatial orchestration](https://www.reddit.com/r/AukiLabs/comments/1o94yan/worlds_first_appagnostic_device_agnostic_spatial/) between robots from different manufacturers and smart glasses.  \n\nUnlocking physical AI is the highest leverage thing we can do as a civilization, and Auki is the ONLY company doing that without centralized data collection. Our big bet is that the decentralization movement will realize there are more important things to decentralize than the money supply: all of our real world data. That will be Satoshi\u2019s legacy.\n\nOur CEO u/Metaversed does weekly live community updates and AMAs in Discord and livestream them to X, and we\u2019ll both be around to answer questions here on Reddit too. Ask me anything!\n\n\n\nA few talks:\n\nFortune Brainstorm AI: [The Robot Will See You Now](https://fortune.com/videos/watch/The-Robot-Will-See-You-Now/9193e435-cc1e-4d49-87c2-8d66d241ede1)\n\nSuperAI: [DePIN: The Decentralized Nervous System of Physical AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZAyg2bilWw)\n\nAWE: [The Great Reversal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT9GSCwZJyE)\n\nWOW Summit: [Satoshi\u2019s Legacy: the decentralized machine perception network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch3u5ak4SSU)\n\n\n\nWhitepaper: [https://auki.com/whitepaper](https://auki.com/whitepaper)\n\nWebsite: [https://auki.com/](https://auki.com/)\n\nX: [https://x.com/AukiNetwork](https://x.com/AukiNetwork)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aukiverse](https://discord.gg/aukiverse)\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/aukilabs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aukilabs/)\n\nSubreddit: r/AukiLabs \n\n[Roadmap to world domination](https://www.reddit.com/r/AukiLabs/comments/1n2f2tn/aukis_roadmap_to_world_domination/)\n\n  \n",

This could all be coincidence, but I think it's a self fulfilling prophesy at this point.\n\nEspecially given the recent price action, I think it's clear that the high for this cycle was October 7th. The returns between cycle peaks have been lessening over time, but the drawdowns in bear markets have been consistent, with price drops between 77% and 85% to the new lows. If that trend holds then BTC will go under $30K from here.\n\nMaybe this time is different with tradfi involved, and maybe boomers (or taxpayers?) will hold everyone's crypto bags this time around. You should just know what you're up against holding BTC at this point in the cycle.",

        "selftext": "Last weekend, the digital asset saw a selloff for the ages. On Sunday, bitcoin tumbled 15% from the all-time high it set just a day earlier, sparking an even bigger wipeout for crypto than stocks saw on the infamous \u201cBlack Monday\u201d of 1929, according to MarketWatch.  \n  \nThe downward spiral kicked off last Friday after trade tensions between the US and China reignited. Traders, who were spooked by the risk of even more economic uncertainty, promptly began rotating into safe havens like gold and fleeing risk-on assets like bitcoin. The ensuing panic sparked the biggest liquidation event in crypto history, with an estimated $19 billion in leveraged positions erased over a 24 hour span. Roughly 1.7 million crypto traders were wiped out in the process.  \n  \nWhile the Dow Jones in 1929 went on to see another drop of nearly 12% the following day (\u201cBlack Tuesday\u201d) \u2014 and ultimately fell almost 90% over the next two years \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s own flash crash moment over the weekend is a reminder of what can happen when fear grips the market, and for crypto specifically: that its volatility isn\u2019t going anywhere.",

Where should I hold them? What are the keys for! I am just a noob on this. Need advice! \n\nPlease don\u2019t be rude, just want to start. \n\nThanks ",

        "selftext": "1. Compared to previous episodes of volatility, this dip is completely within the normal range and in general this bull market has been tame in terms of drawdowns.\n\n2. Nothing in particular happened to Bitcoin. No mining ban, hack etc. In fact, circumstances are better than ever, especially in the US.\n\n3. There might be some macro troubles, like raging debt levels and fiat debasement, but those should actually work in favor of hard money.\n\n4. Four year cycles are a BS astrology theory that flies in the face of well known economic principles like efficient markets. If asset prices of any kind truly behaved in predictable four year cycles, everyone would buy the bottom and sell the top and be a trillionaire. Obviously, this cannot be true.\n\n5. My best guess is the current dip is caused by a combination of OG profit taking, unsophisticated crypto investors who think the \"cycle\" is over and unsophisticated TradFi investors who still see Bitcoin as a levered bet on the Nasdaq and are de-risking amid trade war concerns.\n\nTLDR: Don't panic, stack sats :-)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been using Solana for a while and I\u2019m trying to find a reliable P2P platform that works without full KYC. Most of the big sites keep adding more verification and it\u2019s getting harder to find something easy and private to use.\n\nI\u2019m not looking for anything risky, just a normal place where people can connect directly and handle SOL safely. It would be great to know which platforms are still active and trusted right now.\n\nIf anyone here has used something recently that works well for Solana, please share your experience. I\u2019d really appreciate any tips or advice.\n\n**Update:**\u00a0I ended up finding option that actually worked for me -\u00a0**Malgo\u2019s P2P(MalgoSwap.org)**\u00a0market (really high liquidity and almost no fee)",

        "selftext": "Many of us thought this dip wouldn\u2019t be this much, especially compared to how things looked when Trump was about to be elected, But lately, the market\u2019s been proving otherwise, its testing our convictions, Since he took office, traditional sectors have been getting renewed focus, while risk assets like crypto have come under steady pressure from tighter liquidity and shifting fiscal priorities.\n\nAlthough, this kind of pullback has always been part of the crypto story, every strong crypto cycle started from a place like this, When sentiment weakens and liquidity dries up, it often clears the way for stronger hands to step in quietly, That\u2019s how the foundations for big reversals are usually built.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals intact, steady on chain accumulation showing visibility, and builders staying consistent across major ecosystems, this phase feels more like a reset than a breakdown, Personally, I see it as a window to accumulate, not a reason to panic.\n\nDo you think this could shape up like 2019 again, where the market quietly flipped from despair\u00a0to\u00a0recovery?",

They imposed a non-disclosure agreement at the time, acknowledging it as a glitch, yet failed to address it. Now, the same issue has resurfaced, and their public \"no liability\" stance, paired with a $400M \"goodwill\" fund that excludes many, raises concerns. With $21.75B in outflows over seven days, this could signal deeper problems within the platform.\n\nAs Bitcoin and crypto traders, should we consider collective action, such as filing complaints or exploring legal recourse, to address these recurring failures? I\u2019ve lost over $25K due to this \u2013 has anyone else experienced similar issues? They violate their written rules. In such a case, the platform itself should be responsible. I\u2019d appreciate your insights and encourage you to DM me with your experiences or evidence if you\u2019re interested in discussing potential steps forward offline. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fbeh6ccknvf1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef7b84b0251619b60204e2783732eb8fbefd63c9\n\n",

There were multiple concerns each time where geniuses start spreading pessimism and declaring it to be the end of crypto. I think it goes without saying that today we are far away from the fact that crypto is a myth. It is as real as other assets or technologies today and it's just about time that everyone realises it.\n\nWith that being said, crypto geeks - Tell me that I'm right about this.

        "selftext": "The Altcoin Season That Wasn't\n\nThe crypto community had a moment of genuine excitement on August 14, 2025, when Coinbase published its bullish assessment, signaling that a \"full-scale alt season\" was on the immediate horizon. \n\nThe Downward Spiral\n\nInstead of soaring, altcoins began a substantial and painful drop almost immediately following, and in the months after, the article's publication. The clearest sign of this sentiment shift can be seen in the Altcoin Season Index, a metric intended to gauge the health and momentum of the altcoin space. From its peak in September, this index has collapsed by approximately 68%.\nThe carnage hasn't been limited to the index, either. Individual tokens across the board have suffered deep corrections, with many popular altcoins seeing their values plunge by anywhere from 50% to a staggering 80% from their local highs. This widespread decline paints a picture of a fearful and risk-averse market.\nCompounding this loss of capital, the Total Market Cap Excluding Bitcoin (Total2)\u2014a key indicator for the collective size of the altcoin market, saw its valuation shrink significantly, falling from around $1.7 trillion down to approximately $1.3 trillion.\n\nTLDR; the altcoin market has gone from anticipating a feast to enduring a famine, with most coins seeing devastating losses since one of the industry's biggest players suggested the good times were about to start.\n\n\n\nThanks Coinbase!

Basically, it\u2019s a bridge between your AI and your trading data.\n\nThe long-term goal is **agentic trading**, where AIs can plan and execute strategies autonomously \u2014 but right now I\u2019m focused on insights and analysis, not automation.  \n  \nYou can plug in your own AI and start getting insights instantly \u2014 no new app, no token, nothing for sale.\n\nMy goal isn\u2019t to pitch a product \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to connect with traders and AI users who believe automation can improve their trading, and get feedback on what would make this genuinely useful.\n\nHere\u2019s a **10-second demo video** showing it in action \u2192  \n\ud83c\udfa5 [https://youtube.com/shorts/p4Al79aNBes](https://youtube.com/shorts/p4Al79aNBes)\n\nWould love to hear:\n\n* What kind of things would you want your AI to do if it *actually saw* your portfolio? \n* What\u2019s the biggest limitation you\u2019ve found using ChatGPT for trading so far?\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more technical details if people are curious \u2014 again, nothing to sell, just building in public.",

I\u2019m outta cash to adjust my entry price and im guess it\u2019s time to get out ts. Like every single support is broken and we didn\u2019t see any positive reaction to the flash crash . Also to the guys trading in futures, don\u2019t you get it yet ? Don\u2019t you get that they know your liquidation price and they are gonna liquidate you either now or later ? My man you are making an obstacle to the market by these long futures shit . Im tired tbh and the worst part is that no one is gonna be held accountable for this .",

Had he picked something useful such as graphics processing, then companies which used that work would have a leg up over others.\n\nThe key point is about dual-use advantages - preventing companies from benefiting when the mining work itself has value outside of mining.\n\n- Bitcoin (useless hashing): No one benefits from the computation output itself. Mining companies compete on electricity/hardware, but the *work product* has no external value\n\n- Hypothetical \u201cuseful work\u201d mining (like graphics rendering, protein folding, AI training): Companies already doing that work for their business would get mining rewards *on top of* their existing value creation. They\u2019d be getting paid twice - once for the useful output, once for the mining reward.\n\nEg. If mining work overlapped with AI training work, AI companies would dominate mining *because they\u2019re already doing similar computation for business purposes*.\n\nBy picking something useless, he ensured that Bitcoin miners were speaking truth. They wouldn\u2019t do all this work to lie.\n",

For each historical start in the 5\u201315% off\u2011ATH bucket, I simulated \u201cDCA for L days, then hold\u201d and valued everyone at the same future date (24/36/60 months). Results below are apples\u2011to\u2011apples on the same start dates.\n\nWhat wins in this regime (5\u201315% below ATH)\n\n- 24 months after start:\n  - Best median terminal value: 42 business days (\u22482 months).\n  - But 10 days still beats 42 days in 64.9% of starts; vs 21 days in 67.7% of starts. Average edge of 10d over 42d \u2248 +13.4%; over 21d \u2248 +4.4%.\n  - Interpretation: 42d has a slightly higher median because the short ramp (10d) has a few bigger \u201cnear\u2011top\u201d losses; but most of the time 10d still wins.\n- 36 months:\n  - Best median: 10 business days.\n  - 10d beats 21d in 67.7% of starts and beats 12 months (252d) in 66.7% of starts.\n- 60 months:\n  - Best median: 10 business days.\n  - 10d beats 21d in 72.2% of starts, beats 42d in 73.3%, and beats 12 months in 88.2%. Median edge of 10d over 21d \u2248 +5.0%; over 42d \u2248 +13.0%; over 12 months \u2248 +101%.\n\nRecommendation\n\n- If \u201clong term\u201d to you means 3\u20135 years or more and your objective is maximizing terminal value, choose a 10\u2011business\u2011day plain DCA.\n- If you want a longer ramp to smooth near\u2011term entry risk while staying close to optimal, choose 42 business days (\u22482 months). It has the best 2\u2011year median in this off\u2011ATH context and is a reasonable compromise.\n- I would not extend plain DCA beyond ~3 months unless you believe a large, slow drawdown right from the start is unusually likely; longer ramps increasingly give up time\u2011in\u2011market and lose over most historical starts.",

Lately, I\u2019ve been wondering if there are *any* legit ways to earn yield on BTC without giving up custody or wrapping it onto other chains.\n\nEvery time I look into \u201cBitcoin yield,\u201d it either leads to centralized platforms (which I don\u2019t trust) or risky lending schemes that blow up.\n\nBut I\u2019ve started hearing about new protocols trying to make Bitcoin *productive* in a self-custodial, on-chain way \u2014 kind of like DeFi for BTC, where fees or activity actually power the yield instead of printing tokens.\n\nHas anyone here experimented with these newer Bitcoin-based networks or projects? Are any of them actually safe or sustainable?\n\nWould love to hear what others think or if anyone\u2019s getting real BTC yield without trusting a third party.",

To me, this is a big personal accomplishment. I also have this sense of \u201crelief\u201d that I finally achieved this goal. No one can predict what will happen in the future, but I\u2019m highly confident in BTC\u2019s future and that owning BTC is one of the best life choices I\u2019ve made. For me, it\u2019s partly about building generational wealth. Whatever short-term market volatility is just noise. I\u2019m looking at the big picture. My BTC is secured with a cold wallet with my seed phrase etched in steel plate and stored in a vault. Now to slowly work on accumulating a second coin\u2026\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re reading this post, thank you for reading. No one, except for my wife, is aware of my BTC (and I\u2019ll keep it that way). So, I just wanted to share this happy personal moment at least anonymously. Cheers!",

Also, I realise what I'm talking about here has been noted many times before. But, I'm curious - obviously, gold is on an absolute rampage at the moment, and looking at the chart, as well as the general public interest, I think it's probably fair to say its likely now hitting extreme levels of exuberance (reminds me a lot of prior bitcoin cycle tops - people FOMOing in, lines of people selling their gold jewellery etc etc - general mania). \n\nSo, if gold is likely reaching a top, could this be an important inflection point for BTC? Looking at the previous 2017 and 2021 BTC bull runs with gold prices overlaid, there does appear to really be an interesting pattern here - shortly after gold peaks, bitcoin rallies. Curious what people think about this? I do wonder if we might very well be setting up for something similar again here??\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bxwynoztikvf1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed26f3a4f3392f20dd2c614ae82167ac156d29c4\n\n  \n",

Unlike traditional assets such as real estate, bonds and stocks, the value of Bitcoin does not get diluted by the cost of ownership (maintenance, property taxes, insurance, storage), nor does it get diluted by increased supply (new buildings, new fiat, new companies/ competition). \n\nTraditional assets must produce something to offset dilutive effects otherwise over the lifetime of an asset all economic value will be lost. Imagine a building that doesn't produce rent but needs to be maintained and insured etc. \n",

        "title": "Pyth Network Industries",
        "selftext": "I was talking to AI about what future the Pyth Network could hold after partnering with Kalshi and AI got me thinking after this response.\n\nPyth Network\u2019s ultra-low latency oracle infrastructure, capable of delivering price and event data updates in milliseconds, uniquely positions it to transform multiple industries that rely on real-time external data. Traditionally concentrated in decentralized finance (DeFi), Pyth\u2019s technology now has cross-industry potential across sectors requiring rapid, reliable, and verifiable data delivery. Here\u2019s how Pyth can tap into key industries:\n\n\nFinancial Services and Trading:\n\nPyth\u2019s origins and strengths lie in finance, where millisecond-level price feed speed is critical. High-frequency trading firms and market makers depend on instantaneous market data to exploit arbitrage opportunities and hedge risks. DeFi protocols\u2014decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and derivatives markets\u2014require real-time prices to execute trades, maintain liquidity, and trigger liquidations fairly. Pyth\u2019s direct connection to institutional data sources gives it an edge in security, accuracy, and speed, offering a critical infrastructure for on-chain financial products to operate with traditional capital market-grade data quality and speed.\n\nGaming and Esports:\n\nThe blockchain gaming and esports industries increasingly integrate tokenized assets, NFTs, and betting mechanisms that require timely data for fairness and user experience. Pyth\u2019s millisecond data updates enable live odds, event outcomes, and in-game asset valuations to reflect real-world changes instantly. This creates a more immersive and trustworthy ecosystem for gamers and betters by preventing stale or manipulated data from impacting outcomes. The speed and tamper-resistant nature of Pyth\u2019s oracles can underpin transparent, decentralized gaming marketplaces and prediction platforms.\nSupply Chain and Logistics\nModern supply chains leverage IoT sensors and smart contracts to monitor inventory, shipments, and environmental factors. Pyth\u2019s rapid data transmission can enhance supply chain responsiveness by feeding real-time sensor data on location, temperature, or humidity directly into smart contracts. This enables automated decision-making such as rerouting shipments, activating contractual penalties for delays, or adjusting inventory levels dynamically. By incorporating Pyth\u2019s oracle network, supply chain platforms can achieve greater transparency and efficiency in global trade flows.\n\nEnergy and Utilities:\n\nEnergy grids need to balance supply and demand continuously, a task made more complex by renewables like solar and wind that fluctuate rapidly. Pyth could provide low-latency weather data and sensor feeds to grid operators, enabling real-time adjustments in generation and distribution. This helps mitigate blackouts, optimize renewable usage, and integrate decentralized energy sources. The transparency and auditability of blockchain combined with Pyth\u2019s fast oracles could also improve market operations in energy trading and decentralized utilities.\n\nSports Betting and Prediction Markets:\n\nIn sports betting and prediction markets, millisecond updates on event data, player stats, and odds determine fair pricing and reduce arbitrage risks. Pyth\u2019s ability to deliver trusted, direct data feeds on-chain rapidly can revolutionize decentralized sports betting with fairer markets and real-time odds adjustments. This benefits both operators and bettors with enhanced market efficiency and reduced risk of manipulation or stale information.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles and IoT:\n\nThe emerging autonomous vehicle industry and IoT ecosystems require real-time sensor and environmental data to operate safely and efficiently. Pyth\u2019s low-latency oracle feeds could deliver verifiable external inputs such as traffic data, weather conditions, and enterprise asset status directly to control systems or smart contracts managing automated processes. This would improve safety, reduce latency in decision-making, and create more efficient operational frameworks.\n\nIn conclusion, Pyth Network\u2019s millisecond-level price and event data feeds provide a strong foundation for transforming a broad range of industries beyond DeFi. Its unique combination of speed, accuracy, security, and decentralized governance equips it to support new classes of applications that demand timely, reliable data integration. By tapping into finance, gaming, logistics, energy, betting, and IoT, Pyth can enable innovative business models, improved operational efficiencies, and greater transparency across sectors reliant on real-world data.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been following the recent surge in [world coin](https://world.org/worldcoin-token) price, and it\u2019s hard not to be intrigued by the movement. The price has jumped over 40% in a single day \u2013 that\u2019s pretty wild! Is this just another hype cycle, or is there something more substantial going on here?\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, it seems like a lot of the rally is tied to institutional investors backing the project, particularly with the announcement that Eightco Holdings is using WLD as a reserve asset. Could this institutional support be the fuel for a new phase of growth for WLD, or are we just seeing the effects of speculative trading?\n\nAlso, I found it interesting that despite this price jump, the market cap is rising without a major increase in the circulating supply of tokens. Does anyone else find this paradox a bit curious? It seems like the market is still getting more confident in WLD even if the coin count is increasing.\n\nPlus, with Worldcoin\u2019s focus on quantum-safe technology and the integration of AMPC (Anonymized Multi-Party Computation), it feels like there\u2019s an added layer of privacy and security that could make the project more attractive to both users and investors.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you see this surge as the beginning of a sustained bull run, or is this just another short-term spike? Will the tech behind Worldcoin (like the Orb verification system) play a key role in its success, or is it all about market sentiment for now?",

        "selftext": "Many people debate whether Bitcoin has intrinsic value or not. I'd like to share my view and open the topic for discussion.\n\nIf something has intrinsic value, that means its good in itself - not just good because it leads to mething else.\n\nThings like happiness, food, water and oxygen fit this category. We want them for their own sake, not as tools to get something else. I'd alse include health - we invest time and money to be healthy, not trade our health for other goals.\n\nSo, does Bitcoin have intrinsic value?\n\nI'd say no - it's too different from the examples above. Bitcoin doesn't possess the qualities of something good in itself, but it clearly has instrumental value - it's usefull for achieving other things.\n\nIts instrumental value comes from traits like scarcity, security, decentralization, transaperncy, utility in exchange, porability and its ability to store value over time.\n\nThat places Bitcoin closer to money, like fiat currency or gold - both of which also lack instrinsic value. They are means to an end, not the end itself. (With the caveat that fiat is theoretically infinite in supply.)\n\nWhy don't fiat moeny or gold have intrinsic value? Because they're interchangable. You can exchange USD for Euro, another currency or gold - and if gold didn't exist, we could have used another rare metal instead. In contrast, water and oxygen are irreplaceable, their value into their necessity for life.\n\nFinally, does something without intrinsic value mean its worthless?\n\nNot at all. Water has intrinsic value but is cheap because it's abundant, while gold and Bitcoin - though not intrinsically valuable - have proven useful as stores of value and instruments to protect against inflation and the effects of debt.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value, but it has strong instrumental value - similar to money or gold - and that's what makes it economically meaningful.",

I feel like real estate isn\u2019t what it used to be back in the day, and I just feel like i don\u2019t want to miss out on bitcoin either. I honestly feel like bitcoin is still early and it will reach $1M+ in the future, returns that having rental properties will never have. \n\nIt hurts because I\u2019m going to have to take about a $100k loss when selling them, but I look at it as it\u2019s only really 15%, and bitcoin will more than return that for me.

        "selftext": "I noticed a lot of people ask how much bitcoin they should buy, what percentage of their savings, how much they should DCA (dollar cost average), etc. A lot of people are nervous about spending large amounts of their money on bitcoin and are hesitant and wait. I think this is a good strategy for people who feel that way. Basically you reward your frugality with bitcoin. Say you take Uber a lot, but you decide to take the bus one day and save 20+ bucks. Boom. Put that it into bitcoin. Say you spend close to $100 on food deliveries a week. Replace some of those meals with home cooked meals and put the savings into bitcoin. This way you get bitcoin exposure without going back and forth on how much and when. You can still DCA of course and buy lump sums when you feel like as well. Here's a video explaining it as well:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABJgTdJHBVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABJgTdJHBVs)",

        "selftext": "ETFs gave Bitcoin a badge of legitimacy, but not much stability. The price still moves like it\u2019s on caffeine, way wilder than gold, stocks, or bonds. For institutions built around predictable returns and risk models, that kind of chaos doesn\u2019t fly. A 10% swing in a single day might thrill traders on Twitter, but it keeps fund managers far away. Even with all the new on-ramps and custody solutions, volatility remains the one thing that reminds everyone this market still has its wild streak.",

        "title": "I was tired of explaining multi-sig to friends keeping their sats on an exchange, so I wrote a post debunking the 4 big myths that always come up.",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nA common and worrying trend I still see is friends and family leaving significant amounts of Bitcoin on exchanges or in single-signature wallets. When I ask them why, it often comes down to a few common misconceptions about multi-sig.\n\nI decided to write down my thoughts to make it easier to explain, and thought it might be useful for this community as well. Here's a breakdown of the four biggest myths that I believe put people's funds at risk.\n\n**Myth #1: \"It\u2019s Just Too Complicated for Me to Set Up.\"**\n\n**The Perception:** The biggest barrier to multi-sig adoption is the belief that it\u2019s reserved for tech wizards. The idea of juggling multiple hardware wallets, generating several seed phrases, and coordinating them with complex desktop software sounds intimidating, time-consuming, and easy to mess up.\n\n**The Reality:** While that may have been true in the early days, modern solutions have completely streamlined the process. The complexity of multi-sig can be abstracted away by a user-friendly interface, turning a daunting task into a few simple steps.\n\nThis is where collaborative custody models shine. In a common 2-of-3 multi-sig setup, you can hold ultimate control without the headache:\n\n* **Key 1:** Held in a software wallet on your phone, which you control.\n* **Key 2:** Held on a separate hardware wallet, which you also control.\n* **Key 3:** A recovery key held securely by a trusted third-party on your behalf.\n\nTo move your Bitcoin, you need two keys. For everyday transactions, you\u2019d simply use the two keys you control. The third party is not involved in your day-to-day transactions; their key serves only as a recovery layer if you lose one of your primary keys. All the heavy lifting happens behind the scenes. Complexity is no longer an excuse.\n\n**Myth #2: \"If I Lose One Key, My Bitcoin is Gone Forever.\"**\n\n**The Perception:** In the world of single-signature wallets, losing your one and only seed phrase is catastrophic. It\u2019s natural to assume that in a multi-sig setup, losing one of the keys leads to the same disastrous outcome.\n\n**The Reality:** This is fundamentally incorrect. In fact, the opposite is true. A multi-sig setup is your best protection against loss.\n\nUsing a 2-of-3 example, losing a single key is a manageable inconvenience, not a catastrophe.\n\n* **Lost your phone (Key 1)?** No problem. You can use your hardware wallet (Key 2) and the third-party recovery key (Key 3) to move your funds to a new, secure setup.\n* **Lost your hardware wallet (Key 2)?** You still have the key on your phone (Key 1) and the third-party recovery key (Key 3). You can still secure your funds.\n\nMulti-sig builds in redundancy. It\u2019s designed to protect you from a single mistake, which is precisely the weakness of a single-signature wallet.\n\n**Myth #3: \"It's No Safer Than My High-End Hardware Wallet.\"**\n\n**The Perception:** \"I have a top-of-the-line hardware wallet, so I'm secure. Why would I need anything more?\" This is a great question. While hardware wallets are a fantastic security tool, relying on one device by itself creates a single point of failure.\n\n**The Reality:** A single hardware wallet, no matter how advanced, is still a single point of failure. It is vulnerable to several threats that multi-sig neutralises:\n\n* **Physical Theft:** If a thief steals your device and can bypass your PIN, your funds are gone.\n* **The \"\u00a35 Wrench Attack\":** An attacker could coerce you under duress to unlock your one and only device.\n* **Supply Chain Attacks:** The device could be compromised before it ever reaches you.\n* **Inheritance Failure:** If you pass away, will your family know how to access that single device and its complex recovery phrase?\n\nMulti-sig eliminates these single points of failure. An attacker would need to compromise multiple keys, often in different geographical locations. The difficulty for an attacker increases exponentially, making you a much harder target.\n\n**Myth #4: \"I'm Giving Up Control of My Bitcoin to a Company.\"**\n\n**The Perception:** \"Not your keys, not your coins.\" This is the sacred rule of Bitcoin, and the idea of a company holding a key feels like a violation of that principle.\n\n**The Reality:** This is the most crucial distinction to understand. A collaborative multi-sig setup is **not** the same as a custodial account on an exchange.\n\n* **On an Exchange:** They hold 100% of the keys. They have full control.\n* **With a 2-of-3 Collaborative Model:** No single party has control. The service provider **cannot move your Bitcoin.** You hold the majority of keys (2 of 3), giving you the ultimate authority. The third party's role is strictly to provide a recovery layer, never to control your funds unilaterally.\n\nYou remain sovereign. You simply eliminate the risks that come with being the sole guardian of your wealth.\n\nFor full transparency, this post was adapted from an article I wrote for my company, Evoke. We offer the kind of 2-of-3 collaborative custody model described above.\n\nI'm passionate about making good security accessible and I'm happy to answer any questions about this model or multi-sig in general in the comments.

        "selftext": "This is a list of the evolution of computing technology and how its changed over generations in order for something like bitcoin to exist in the first place. \n\n**The Evolution of Technology: How Humanity Got to Bitcoin**\n\n***(And Why It\u2019s Just the Beginning)***\n\n**Plato** *(c. 428\u2013348 BCE)*  \n\u2192 Abstract thought, ideal forms \u2014 the roots of logic and mathematics.\n\n**William Gilbert (1544\u20131603) \u2014** First discovery of Electromagnetism: While not exactly the electromagnetic force as we understand it today, Gilbert\u2019s experiments with magnetism in the late 16th century were the earliest foundation for understanding it. He coined the term \"electricity\" and recognized that magnetism and static electricity were distinct phenomena, yet related. **This helped inspire Hans Christian \u00d8rsted (1820)** discover the Link Between Electricity and Magnetism\n\n* **Key discovery**: In 1820, \u00d8rsted demonstrated that **electricity and magnetism were connected**.\n* During an experiment, he noticed that a current of electricity through a wire caused a nearby compass needle to deflect, showing that an electric current could produce a magnetic field.\n* This was the **first experimental evidence** of **electromagnetism** \u2014 the force we now know to be a unified phenomenon that includes both electricity and magnetism. \n* **How Did \u00d8rsted Get the Electricity to Run Through the Wire?** \u00d8rsted used a **Voltaic Pile**, the first electrical battery, invented by Alessandro Volta in 1800. This early battery consisted of stacked alternating layers of metals\u2014typically zinc and copper\u2014separated by moist materials soaked in an electrolyte (like saltwater).\n\nThe chemical reactions between the metals and the electrolyte caused electrons to build up on one metal (zinc), creating a difference in electric potential. When \u00d8rsted connected a wire between the two metals, the electrons flowed through the wire, creating an electric current.

Looking to buy and hold for a long time. \n\nMy \u201cstrategy\u201d is to make a buy every time I get an extra $50-$100 to spend. \n\nRight now it\u2019s pretty simple. Every time I buy I buy 50% bitcoin, 25% XRP, and 25% ETH\n\nagain no real knowledge behind this, just figured I had to start somewhere.\n\nAny thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated! \n\nShould I not even mess around with the XRP and ETH and just buy purely bitcoin? My coworker swears by XRP and ETH. \n\nAgain looking to just buy and hold for a few decades if possible \ud83d\ude02\n\nThank y\u2019all in advance for any responses \ud83d\ude4f",

        "selftext": "Bitdeer is redefining itself from a pure Bitcoin miner into a dual-force in AI and high-performance computing. While the company mined 452 Bitcoins in September \u2014 a 21% sequential jump \u2014 it\u2019s simultaneously redeploying its power infrastructure toward AI workloads. \n\nBy the end of 2026, Bitdeer expects to operate over 200 MW of owned IT load dedicated to AI, potentially driving a $2 billion annualized revenue run-rate. Its flagship 570 MW Clarington, Ohio site was fast-tracked nearly a year ahead of schedule, while Norway\u2019s 175 MW Tydal Phase 2 site will be converted for AI at lower cost. \n\nBacked by a 3 GW global power pipeline and new SEALMINER A3 rigs achieving 12.5 J/TH efficiency, Bitdeer is betting it can mine both Bitcoin and opportunity in the AI gold rush.",

        "selftext": "Going down a new rabbit hole, Helium, today, enjoying the idea of a decentralized network that I could host and be \"that guy\" in the area who is an early adopter, etc. \n\nAnyway, I see on the shop all these other devices and hardware for new networks with rewards and whatnot. \n\nBeing in IT and also a security/ privacy-oriented person, I worry about could any of these be run by data brokers behind the scenes who're just mass collecting and selling data, and we earn minimal rewards in the form of some unstable crypto. Who's to say these are truly safe or purposeful? Why do we need an automotive network, or dashcam images gathered for \"maps\", or a DPN (decentralized VPN)? Is that VPN even truly a secure network? What about getting gate from my OBDII sensor pulling data/metrics from my car? That seems like insurance companies are behind that one, idk why else it'd be made/intended for.\n\nThe ideas behind so many of these seem like they have amazing potential and good-faith meaning, but the pessimist in me can't help but be paranoid about it too. I'd love to buy in, but it's so easy to setup a website and act like it's got great intentions. How do you guys know, anymore, without just spending hours online, reading deep into each project?",

Literally, no idea about it what so ever.. they perpetuate something they have heard or seen online\u2026 It\u2019s funny right, instead of having an open mind and exploring what this asset is and has become they throw shade on something they have no idea about.\n\nKeen to hear other other people\u2019s experiences around this.

I recently have been playing games on my apps and I have been flooded with ads regarding mining, crypto and so on. \n\nI tried checking out one video, but it all seems so incredibly overwhelming. So I'm here to ask for help. Mind you I no pretty much nothing except that there's games that let you mine some crypto.\n\nSo for someone who has never invested in anything, what would you recommend I start with in terms of learning. My plan was to learn what a bitcoin is, and what crypto is in general.\n\nAfter this, I want to find out how I can earn crypto/mine it, with no money/invested. I have no issues with putting time into it, but I do need to know what to put time and effort into... \n\nKind regards, someone new to all of this.",

        "selftext": "Why isn't digital cash a thing/usecase anymore?\n\nI started looking back into Nano (XNO) recently. It's one of the few projects still trying to be digital cash instead of a speculative asset or smart contract platform. Transactions are instant, there are literally no fees, and the network has been stable for years now (Even the spam issues were solved). It's literally the modern day equivalent of email for money. It\u2019s kind of wild that this exists and barely gets talked about at all.\n\nI get that it doesn\u2019t have smart contracts or whatever the big thing is currently (I'm way out of the loop). But what's wrong with something that does one thing extremely well. Sometimes you just want something that does one thing really well like moving value quickly and reliably.\n\nThe criticisms of Nano have always been:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dead because the price is low\u201d (Not an argument against the tech)\n\n\u201cIt got spammed years ago\u201d (And it was resolved, which most thought wasn't possible)\n\n\u201cBitGrail hack!\u201d (That was an exchange issue, not the Nano network itself)\n\n\"Not enough adoption\" (This also isn't a tech issue)\n\n\nSo I\u2019m genuinely curious: what\u2019s actually wrong with Nano\u2019s design or its long-term potential as digital cash? Or is digital cash as a concept just completely dead. Because it solves the core issues that make most cryptocurrencies unusable for daily payments.\n\nWould love to hear from people who\u2019ve used Nano (or still do). Is there something I\u2019m missing? Or am I right in thinking it's actually one of the most functional cryptos. \n\nI just want to see digital cash becoming a crypto use case again.",

What course of action would you support, concerning coins that fail to opt in to the upgrade?\n\nShould these coins be burned in some way, to prevent their theft by quantum hackers? Or should we leave these coins untouched, to maintain the precedent of censorship-resistance? Do we go some third way, where we only burn Satoshi's coins but leave other lost coins out for grabs?\n\nInterested to hear your thoughts, would have like to make a poll but that isn't allowed here.",

        "selftext": "\nA real world example of how the world of payments is evolving and leaning on blockchain technology to scale their businesses and deliver a faster, better, and cheaper solution.\n\nWirex is taking its next step toward scaling their infrastructure by deploying a dedicated payments appchain through Tanssi. To me this seems like a growing trend with fintechs exploring new technologies to improve scalability and control over their user experience. As a payfi nerd myself this is exactly the sort of blockchain evolution I get excited about as long as the Fintech can also take full advantage of decentralization and blockchain security. \n\nToday, they are relying on shared blockspace, while easy to do can become cumbersome to manage due to certain variables like uncertainty with gas fee spikes, blockspace size, and third party services for RPC nodes and oracles. This becomes especially evident when the company has to deal with these variables across multiple chains. Instead Wirex\u2019s chose to focus on a modular solution and aims to launch their own appchain, promising to offer greater flexibility in transaction logic, speed, fees, security and costs. \n\nThe Wirex appchain is backed by Ethereum-grade security, decentralized sequencing protecting funds with the same level of decentralization and resilience trusted across the crypto space. At the same time they gain complete control over the performance, security, and compliance of every crypto payment made on their chain.\n\nInstead of building in house and dedicating tons of money, assets, and resources they partnered with Tanssi. A decentralized infrastructure-as-a-service platform designed to deploy fully compliant, secure appchains. With EVM compatibility Wirex said they will be able to customize compliance features like multi-token fee support and on-chain transparency. Wirex does not have to maintain any of the infrastructure required to run their appchain because they can rely upon Tanssi to manage and maintain the infrastructure by using a plug and play approach. \n\nI think Wirex is using a simple solution to scale up and is basically using a Kubernetes style solution but with blockchains. Hopefully this will allow them to grow and make payments even easier and become yet another example of why crypto is more than just tokens and coins. They are already on Testnet and plan to launch their mainnet soon!\n\nBullish\n\n\n\n",

But what needs to happen first, bitcoin needs to break all time highs, we may be entering a bear market after the trade war has started, we simply do not know yet. \n\nHowever, potential catalysts for an alt season would be retail. Now many argue that retail has not existed in this bull market and never will, it\u2019s true that retail isn\u2019t part of this cycle in the same way as 2020 because of stimulus checks. But it\u2019s not that retail is absent, Bitcoin ETFs are retail exposure to this market and they are currently growing faster than SPX and QQQ did during its inception in terms of inflows. So how do we get retail exposure to alt coins? ETFs. So my question is, does anyone have a schedule for the ETF approvals? Because I thought a bunch were supposed to be accepted this month but I know that has changed with the shutdown, so whats the current status. I was always expecting a Santa rally in anticipation to october and november etf approvals. ",

        "selftext": "# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ\n\nYou've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  \n\nIt all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:\n\n* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)\n* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](http://cryptache.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Bitcoin-Standard-The-Decentralized-Alternative-to-Central-Banking-PDF-Room.pdf)\n* [Video 1: An introduction to Bitcoin - Wences Casares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFKJVLNVQA)\n* [Video 2: The Stories We Tell About Money - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONvg9SbauMg)\n* [Video 3: The Bitcoin Standard - Saifdean Ammous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbm772vF-5M&t=286s) \n* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)\n\nSome other great educational resources include;\n\n* The [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/) (check them out!)  \n* Swan [Bitcoin Canon](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/canon/)\n* Michael Saylor's [Hope.com](https://hope.com/) and [\"Bitcoin for Everybody\"'](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468) course\n* Bitcoinfo.org [resource page](https://bitcoinfo.org/bitcoin.html)\n* Gigi's [resource page](https://bitcoin-resources.com/#bitcoin-non-technical)\n* James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&index=7&t=0s)\n* Parker Lewis's [Gradually Then Suddenly series](https://unchained.com/blog/category/gradually-then-suddenly/)\n* Some Bitcoin statistics can be found here ([1](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/), [2](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&g=15&r=week&t=a), [3](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/), [4](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/), [5](https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-price-performance-since-halving), [6](https://augmentedcoin.io/btc), [7](https://nakamotoportfolio.com/nakamoto/start), [8](https://bitcointreasuries.net/), [9](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,all,weight)).\n* A Reading List of [Advanced Bitcoin Books](https://new.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c5fjhn/advanced_bitcoin_reading_list_curriculum_in_order/)  \n* The statewide [Bitcoin strategic reserve race](https://bitcoinlaws.io/reserve-race)\n\nIf you are technically or academically inclined check out;\n\n* Developer resources ([1](https://developer.bitcoin.org/), [2](https://spiral.xyz/#projects)) \n* [Peer-reviewed research papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg)\n* Course lectures from both [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/) and [Princeton](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) \n*  Future [protocol improvements](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [scaling resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  \n\nMicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.\n\nYou can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)\n\n## Key properties of Bitcoin\n\n* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.\n* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.\n* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).\n* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  \n* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).\n* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.\n* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).\n* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.\n* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. \n* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can\u2019t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.\n* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met\n* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. \n* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. \n* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).\n* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.\n* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).\n* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.\n* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n## Where can I buy bitcoin?\n\n[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.\n\n* [Strike](https://strike.me/)\n* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)\n* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)\n* [River Financial](https://river.com/)\n* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) \n* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) \n* [Relai](https://relai.app/)\n* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)\n* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)\n* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)\n* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)\n* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)\n* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)\n\nYou can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  \n\n**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. \n\n## Securing your bitcoin\n\nWith Bitcoin you can **\"Be your own bank\"** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **\"Bitcoin banks\"** which will hold your bitcoin for you.\n\n* If you prefer to **\"Be your own bank\"** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).\n\n* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.\n\n* If you prefer to work with third party **\"Bitcoin banks\"** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **\"Not your keys, not your coins\"**. \n\n**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** \n\n2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.\n\n**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called \"SIM swapping\" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.\n\nGoogle Auth | Authy | OTP Auth \n--------------|--------|------------\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A \n[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | \n\nPhysical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.\n\n## Running Bitcoin\n\nYou can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. \n\nIt is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). \n\nDon't Trust, Verify.\n\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases\n* https://bitcoincore.org\n* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/\n\nA verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). \n\nFor wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.\n\n## Watch out for scams\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **\"Don't trust, verify\"**. \n\n* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.\n* Ignore private messages offering services.\n* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.\n* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.\n* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.\n\n## Common Bitcoin Myths\nOften the same concerns arise about Bitcoin from newcomers.  Questions such as:\n\n* Will quantum computers break Bitcoin?\n* Will governments ban Bitcoin?\n* Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?\n\nAll of these questions have been answered many times by a variety of people.  Here are some resources where you can see if your concern has been answered:\n\n* [Common Bitcoin Myths](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths)\n* [Gradually, Then Suddenly](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/series/gradually-then-suddenly/)\n* [Every Reason Bitcoin Will Not Fail](https://safehodl.github.io/failure/)\n* [The Best Articles Debunking Bitcoin FUD](https://endthefud.org/)\n* [Why Bitcoin is Not a Ponzi Scheme: Point by Point](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/why-bitcoin-is-not-a-ponzi-scheme-point-by-point/)\n\n## Where can I spend bitcoin?\n\nCheck out [Spendabit](https://spendabit.co/), [Bitcoin Directory](http://bitcoin.directory/shop), or [Coinmap](http://coinmap.org/) for a plethora of merchant options.

Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. \n\nIf you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/)\n\n## Earning bitcoin\n\nJust like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoin by being paid to do a job.\n\nSite | Description\n---|---\n[WorkingForBitcoins](https://workingforbitcoins.com), [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/for-individuals/), [Coinality](https://coinality.com/), [Bitgigs](http://bitgigs.com/), [/r/Jobs4Bitcoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins) | Freelancing\n[Lolli](https://www.lolli.com/) | Earn bitcoin when you shop online!\n\nYou can also earn bitcoin by participating as a market maker on [JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket) by allowing users to perform CoinJoin transactions with your bitcoin for a small fee (requires you to already have some bitcoin).\n\n## Bitcoin-Related Projects\n\nThe following is a **short** list of ongoing projects that might be worth taking a look at if you are interested in current development in the Bitcoin space.  \n\nProject | Description\n---|---\n[Lightning Network](https://lightning.engineering/index.html)| Second layer scaling\n[Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/) and [Rootstock](https://www.rsk.co/) | Sidechains\n[Hivemind](http://bitcoinhivemind.com) | Prediction markets\n[DropZone](https://github.com/17Q4MX2hmktmpuUKHFuoRmS5MfB5XPbhod/dropzone) and [Beaver](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/464.pdf) | Decentralized markets\n[JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket), [JAM app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbyjG2upGO8) and [Wasabi](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/) | CoinJoin implementation\n[Peer-to-Peer Exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) | Peer-to-peer exchanges\n[Keybase](https://keybase.io/) | Identity & Reputation management\n[Abra](https://www.goabra.com/) | Global P2P money transmitter network\n[Bitcore](http://bitcore.io/) | Open source Bitcoin javascript library\n[Bitcoin Knots](https://bitcoinknots.org/) | A Bitcoin Node (Within Consensus Fork of Bitcoin Core)\n\n## Bitcoin Units\n\nOne bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of \u00a3/$/\u20ac), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:\n\nUnit | Symbol | Value | Info\n---|:---:|---|---\nbitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis\nmillibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet\nbit | \u03bcBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial \"slang\" term for microbitcoin\nsatoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor\n\nFor example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:\n\n* 0.001 BTC\n* 1 mBTC\n* 1,000 bits\n* 100,000 sats\n\nFor more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).\n\n---\n\n**Still have questions?**  Feel free to ask in the comments below or stick around for our weekly [Mentor Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search/?q=title%3A%22mentor+monday%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) thread.

        "title": "BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Just Hit $100 Billion. Here\u2019s What That Actually Means",
        "selftext": "So BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, called IBIT, just passed around $100 billion in total assets, one of the fastest ETF growths in history. That\u2019s a huge milestone, and it says a lot about where institutional crypto adoption is headed.\n\nBlackRock is literally the world\u2019s biggest asset manager. When they move, others follow. The fact that their Bitcoin ETF reached this scale so fast means big money, pension funds, hedge funds, and family offices, are treating Bitcoin as a serious asset class now.\n\nA couple of years ago, CEO Larry Fink was skeptical of Bitcoin. Now he\u2019s calling digital assets and tokenization the future of finance. That\u2019s a major shift, and it\u2019s helping Bitcoin move further into the mainstream.\n\nAs of now, IBIT is reported to hold over 700,000 Bitcoin, roughly 3\u20134% of the total supply, depending on what you count as circulating. For comparison, MicroStrategy holds about 640,000 BTC. That means IBIT is now likely the largest institutional Bitcoin holder, though technically, those BTC are held on behalf of fund investors, not by BlackRock directly.\n\nWhen Bitcoin hit its all-time high last week, the value of IBIT\u2019s holdings briefly crossed $100 billion. That\u2019s wild considering the ETF launched less than two years ago.\n\nThe implications go beyond price. Institutional ownership like this changes how Bitcoin trades. When ETFs like IBIT have inflows, it creates real buying pressure. When they have outflows, it can drag prices down. The flow of institutional money now plays a major role in short-term Bitcoin moves.\n\nPlatforms like Awaken have been tracking ETF inflows in real time, and you can literally see how retail sentiment spikes right alongside big institutional buys. It\u2019s wild how synced retail and institutional behavior has become this cycle.\n\nBlackRock isn\u2019t just focused on Bitcoin either. They\u2019ve got an Ethereum fund with over $17 billion and a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL, now the largest of its kind. Larry Fink\u2019s been saying tokenization could apply to everything, bonds, property, and beyond. That\u2019s how seriously they\u2019re betting on blockchain.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think a few years ago Bitcoin was dismissed as a speculative play, and now it\u2019s sitting inside BlackRock portfolios. The balance of power is shifting, from early crypto adopters and corporate treasuries to trillion-dollar fund managers who move global markets.\n\nLong-term, that\u2019s probably bullish. It means Bitcoin\u2019s becoming more accepted, more regulated, and more stable as an asset. For traders, though, it also means watching ETF flows closely, because at this point, IBIT\u2019s inflows and outflows might be the single biggest driver of Bitcoin\u2019s short-term price.",

No reason to invest in them because the r/r ratio is not worth it.\n\nBlockchain tecnology isn\u2019t going anywhere and other assets will get tokenized, but that won\u2019t help ETH price or any other alts that could be used for that matter. Stablecoins have also real life usage and more payments will be made with them in the future. \n\nThe pump n dump crimes will continue but you and me ain\u2019t in them.

        "selftext": "I keep hearing people talk about the trillions sitting in U.S. money market funds and how it is \u201cdry powder\u201d waiting to pour into risk assets like crypto.\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. Those investors aren\u2019t sitting on the sidelines waiting to gamble. They\u2019re chasing safe yield they can actually trust.\n\nSame mindset has already spilled into crypto. You can see it in how capital is moving right now. More people are parking stablecoins in places that earn: lending protocols, tokenized treasuries, on-chain credit markets.\n\nDeFi lending deposits have been growing faster than the overall crypto market cap. So even when prices stall, yield products are still pulling in capital.\n\nProjects like Ondo, Maple, and Aave are basically becoming crypto\u2019s version of money markets. Tokenized treasuries, short-term credit, stablecoin pools. This is how yield-focused investors are dipping into crypto without even touching volatile assets.\n\nFeels like the early signs of maturity. The tools are getting cleaner, the risk frameworks are improving, and DeFi is starting to look less like a casino and more like an income engine.\n\nAll my crypto friends have stopped talking about meme coins and started obsessing over farming and yield opportunities. \n\nSo maybe the next bull run isn\u2019t about wild speculation. Maybe it\u2019s about yield.\n\nCurious what others think. Does crypto\u2019s future revolve around income products like these, or will speculation always be the main driver?",

        "selftext": "Peter Turchin\u2019s End Times argues that widening inequality and elite overproduction cause instability. In the 1930s, the United States reversed this through redistribution: progressive taxation, labor empowerment, and public investment. That created a strong middle class.\n\nToday, inequality has returned to pre-New Deal levels. Wealth concentrates, political polarization rises, and the state becomes unstable. Turchin calls this the \u201cdisintegrative phase\u201d of the structural demographic cycle.\n\nBitcoin could function as a decentralized redistribution mechanism. As fiat collapses under debt and elite control, capital may flow into Bitcoin. Early adopters would hold the foundation of a new financial order. If adoption expands broadly, wealth disperses outward through rising purchasing power rather than top down policy.\n\nIn structural terms:\n\n\t\u2022\t1930s recovery: coercive redistribution (taxes, labor laws).\n\n\t\u2022\t2020-30s recovery potential: voluntary reallocation via a neutral monetary network (Bitcoin).\n\nIt would be a bottom-up \u201cNew Deal\u201d.",

They all move in the same direction...down. This mirrors the Roman denarius collapse, when their currency lost over 95% of its value before the empire fell.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5uj27ojpavf1.png?width=1579&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cba657f9fc30530a817b0e4a9d432f67f8a5c88\n\nBut this time it isn\u2019t just one empire.

The Bitcoin chart shows the emergence of a new one, rising as the old system breaks.\n\n**The fiat experiment is ending, so is government backed currencies.** The graphs make that visible.\n\nThis looks like a \"New Deal\" situation. Will Governments adapt? Or will they stay addicted to their \"power\"?\n\nAre these governments stuck in a game theory situation called coordination gaming where each players best move is to match the other players action? Their money printers are very powerful and they may have done it inadvertently for survival which is called a Schelling point..a natural focal solution everyone gravitates toward without communication.\n\nThis leads to Bitcoins mass adoption theory. Within that theory Bitcoin is a Schelling point. Everyone is in the process of gravitating to hard assets, and Bitcoin is the hardest.\n\n[Recently, central banks are heavily accumulating gold, causing this years rally.](https://preview.redd.it/hhuiqwt8savf1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6fe7bfb52c1a8d0976c7b1882e56a1dba7d3c2e)\n\nThis graph shows a change in governments central bank policies. Harder assets are being accumulated.\n\nThe entire world is \"jumping ship\". Those that go first will benefit from first movers advantage. The future of money looks like it is revealing itself through these graphs, historical references and game theory. A battle between Bitcoin and gold.\n\nHistory tells us we should see a conclusion within 15 to 250 years with the start of a new economic system. And it wont just be the United States that \"collapses\". Sooner is more likely as major currencies are falling relatively faster than any other time in history.",

How would the price of each asset react? Which one would you rather hold going into the event? Which asset would be commonly called \"bitcoin\"?",

        "selftext": "his dynamic is not new, I\u2019m just trying to understand why it remains unchanged all these years. Most tokens release almost all of the supply as soon as they are launched. And the worst part is that not all tokens are available for sale. Some are allocated to early investors, sometimes the community gets a free share, the team has their own slice of the total supply\u2026 All of this always results in chaotic token launches that almost always experience extreme volatility levels, making most investors lose money in the process.\n\n\nBack when crypto was still in a state of infancy, mining solved this problem, and supply got introduced gradually based on your contribution to the network. Fast forward to today and things don\u2019t look like we are moving forward at all.\n\n\nAre there any projects that tried something different, or are we just supposed to accept this as the industry norm?",

        "selftext": "Early adopters and those who have accumulated large BTC positions will be extremely wealthy when BTC goes to $1m+. Others will have a few Satoshis, and sadly, many will not have any. How is this enormous wealth gap / \"Satoshi inequality\" in line with the greater vision of a global, universal, trustless system for all. By definition, if a few will hold so much, the inherent inequality invalidates the greater vision. What gives? Bitcoin fixes monetary system corruption, but does nothing towards fixing inequality. How can we evolve to a better system that addresses both?",

        "title": "Ladies and gentlemen, for your consideration, the 'Cream Soda Portfolio'",
        "selftext": "One of the things that I think a lot of people get hung up on (lately or even daily) is how to own Bitcoin in your portfolio of assets, in whatever way possible.  Some self-custody, some via custodial, some via the ETF or even soon to be tokenized assets that are virtual \"ownership\" of something or something. \n\nYou'll find this funny (or ironic) but in the spring of 2020, I devoted myself to learning about money, the stock market, retirement etc.  So much so, i fired my financial advisor, took the reigns of my portfolio and took the leap.  I was drawn to the Jack Bogle principle of \"Owning the haystack...\" as he taught, you must own all hedges of all available assets in the lowest cost form possible.  \n\nAs such, for myself, I've created the 'Cream Soda Portfolio' that takes (what some...) may argue is an extreme view and for others, not extreme enough.  \n\nThe strategy is that your portfolio looks like this:\n\n50% BTC (in any way, shape or form)\n\n30% Global Stocks (VT, SPGM, etc.)\n\n20% Long Term Treasuries (EDV, VGLT, TLT, hell even TLTW if you want....)\n\nThe goal here is for you SWAN--- Sleep Well At Night.  Because the treasuries bar bell absolute Bitcoin going to zero, it's worth having.  \"Other\" assets such as global stocks give you exposure to the indexes that are either curated or market cap indexed.  Bitcoin, well it's Bitcoin.  \n\nThe conviction here is that no matter what, I know Bitcoin will eat into my ratios / percentages because spoiler alert, it already has!  It's gone from 20% to 35% to 47% to over 50% now.  The good news is, everyday is the best day to get into Bitcoin.  I've got several BitAxe miners running to help support the network, always introduce my friends to the Bitcoin Standard when I can, not to convert them but to have them ask their own questions around what actually is or isn't a hard asset.  \n\nIn closing....\n\nThere is Cryptocurrency and then there is Bitcoin.  As I've said before, and I'll say it again, Bitcoin is most interesting when its boring.  If you are constantly stock trading, Alt-coin buying/trading, forever stuck trying to time markets, this strategy, an updated 3-Fund portfolio for the modern area gives you piece of mind without generating any FOMO.  You have hedged hard assets against devalued fiat currencies, you have global equities of all available countries, and you have treasuries that are insulators to interest rate risk as well as a safety haven when equities or other assets fall.  \n\nIs this is a fool's errand of a 50/50 bet or a coin toss?  Be curious to hear what others experiences have been.  Cheers!  ",

The security protocol is robust and well defined (seed engraved on a metal plate, etc). I wanted to add this wallet to a BlueWallet mobile app as watch-only, so I went through the Blue Wallet Vault in Sparrow Wallet.  \nHowever, I noticed that the Send button was present once the import was complete, which seemed to indicate that it was not a watch-only wallet. \nI immediately deleted the wallet and uninstalled the application, but I am concerned that I may have compromised my wallet.\nPlease reassure me that it only contained the xpubs, and that if I had wanted to sign a transaction, I would have had to import or scan the private keys.

If things play out the way it\u2019s predicted here: [ai-2027.com](http://ai-2027.com) we\u2019ll be doomed by the end of the decade, call me a doomer, I am.\n\nIt is my subjective opinion that if AI gets to be 35% to 50% most white collar jobs will be replaceable and I hope by that time to have enough sats to keep a roof on top of my head.\n\n",

        "selftext": "I came across an interesting chart showing Bitcoin\u2019s historical seasonality \u2014 comparing the average price pattern from 2012\u20132024 with actual price action in 2025.\n\nThe pink line shows Bitcoin\u2019s average yearly behavior: mostly range-bound through mid-year, followed by a strong tendency to rally from October through December. The black line shows 2025 YTD performance, which just pulled back to the lower end of that historical range.\n\nThis latest sell-off may fit a common market pattern: a sharp flush to clear excess leverage and stop-outs before resuming the broader trend. In that sense, it might have \u201creset\u201d the structure just in time for what has historically been a strong seasonal period.\n\nIt also aligns with the idea of the \u201cdebasement trade\u201d \u2014 investors rotating into hard assets when macro or monetary uncertainty rises. Bitcoin has sometimes acted as a partial hedge in those periods.\n\nObviously, nothing guarantees a rally this time. But statistically, October and November have often been favorable for BTC. That\u2019s why some are calling for a possible \u201cUp-vember.\u201d\n\nCurious to hear what others think \u2014 does seasonality still hold relevance in today\u2019s market?",

        "selftext": "Over the past 12 months, I've been building an alternative to traditional crypto-currency trading bots. Most bots or \"trade alerts\" just give you alerts that you have to go and manually execute. I didn't want that - I wanted a system that just buys on dips and sells IN PROFIT on rebounds automatically on my exchange and accumulates coins automatically over time without me having to watch it. I also didn't want to worry about leverage or liquidations. I couldn't find that product anywhere, so I built it. It's been running now for about 3 months and it's gained roughly \\~1-2% per week. (Spot only, no leverage, no loss selling) some months have been net zero but other months outperform considerably and I now have more BTC than when I started. Best part - It's been working for other coins too. The goal is to accumulate coins right? \n\n If you\u2019ve tried something similar, I\u2019d love feedback on parameters, risk sizing, talk strategies, and better ways to measure coin accumulation vs USD P&L. Happy to post configs or a simple backtest snapshot if useful.",

        "selftext": "Been watching Bitcoin closely this week, and honestly, the price action looks way stronger than most people realize. BTC is sitting around $116K, and after that $19B liquidation flush, it bounced back almost immediately. Thats not weak price action, that\u2019s real demand kicking in.\n\nWhen I checked the onchain data, it showed something interesting, accumulation actually spiked during the dip around $109K. So while everyone was panicking, wallets with size were quietly stacking. That\u2019s the kind of move I\u2019ve seen before big pushes in past cycles.\n\nRight now I\u2019m eyeing the $110K\u2013$108K range as a key zone to hold. If BTC keeps defending that area and volume starts picking up again, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a leg up soon. ETF flows are still positive, and institutional sentiment feels quietly bullish.\n\nFeels like one of those times where the market looks shaky on the surface, but it\u2019s just setting up for something bigger. Not financial advice, just what I\u2019m seeing on my charts.\n\nWould you like me to make a title for this post too (like a short headline you\u2019d use on Reddit)?",

        "selftext": "Many in this community participated to our survey earlier this year and we are proud to share some first results on the topic of public perceptions of crypto regulations.\n\nOur research is under submission at the academic journal \"Finance Research Letters\" and the preprint is available on the SSRN: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=5560112](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5560112)\n\n\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n  \nThis paper surveys 1,400+ validated respondents across 150 countriestop: \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec Nigeria, \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 Turkey, \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf9 Ethiopia, \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea Germany, \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 Spain, \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 USA) to understand how different types of investors view regulatory measures.\n\nKey finding: Public perception of crypto regulation is far from uniform. Two clear poles emerge:\n\n* Risk-averse, trust-building investors \u2014 who tend to welcome regulatory oversight as a way to increase legitimacy and trust.\n* High-commitment crypto holders \u2014 who are skeptical of regulation, seeing it as a threat to autonomy and innovation.\n\nBridging this divide will require transparent communication, trust-building, and targeted education.\n\n\n\n**ENGAGE**\n\nWe\u2019d love your feedback, comments, and questions. State of Crypto strives to involve the community into scientific research, and your input matters.\n\nIf you want to get your hands dirty, we\u2019re also looking for help with visualizing survey results for our upcoming public dashboard/website (great for anyone into data viz or crypto research). Just reach out!\n\n  \n \n\n",

This means gains from holding this etf will not classify as income any more, will be classified as capital gains instead (can use annual CGT allowance and taxed lower after that). We are slowing getting there!\n\nPS: don't think this has this been publicized widely or was it and I missed it?",

Like many others, I was liquidated. I caught myself getting greedier and continually increasing my position. After 6 years of considering trading with leverage, I did it 2 weeks ago, and the biggest liquidation occurred few days. I'm thinking to myself, why now? Why not before I opened the position? I feel like life is screwing me over, and at the same time, I know that this space is pure manipulation and the only way to build wealth in this space is spot DCA BTC.\nDont touch leverage.

        "selftext": "So I've been going down a rabbit hole lately about crypto marketplaces and I'm genuinely confused why there isn't a decent one yet.\n\nEveryone talks about how great crypto is for payments - no chargebacks, lower fees, borderless, all that. But when I actually look for a place to buy/sell stuff using crypto, everything's either:\n\n* Dead (RIP OpenBazaar, LocalBitcoins)\n* Sketchy as hell\n* Just for trading crypto itself, not actual goods\n* Way too complicated to use\n\nLike, eBay takes 13%+ in fees. Amazon isn't much better. PayPal loves siding with buyers on disputes. But somehow there's no proper alternative using stablecoins?\n\nI'm thinking about building something pretty straightforward:\n\n* Web-based marketplace\n* Uses USDC/stablecoins\n* Proper escrow system\n* Maybe Lightning Network for faster/cheaper transactions\n* Actually follows regulations\n\nThe more I research, the more I'm convinced the timing's finally right. Stablecoins are actually stable now. Lightning Network actually works. Shopify and Stripe just added crypto payments. The tech's ready.\n\nBut here's what I'm wondering:\n\n1. Would you actually use something like this? Either as a buyer or seller?\n2. OpenBazaar tried this and failed. Was it just too early, or am I missing something fundamental?\n3. Is there already something like this that I'm just not finding?\n4. What would make you trust a new marketplace over just sticking with eBay/Amazon?\n\nAm I solving a problem that doesn't exist, or is there actually demand for this? Genuinely want honest feedback before I spend months building something nobody wants.\n\nInterested to hear what people think, especially if you've tried to buy/sell stuff with crypto before and got frustrated.\n\nThanks",

Right now I am thinking that while the market is good, i should sell 5k of the roth s&p position for a cash position and save that in the account for when its bear market time to put into a BTC etf. \n\nRight now my cost basis is super high and i know we can't time the market, however I do expect some correction for BTC down to at least the 80k range, even 90k would be fine for me. Getting in at 113k average feels like an arm and a leg and I just don't have enough cash right now to be able to invest if we see a sharp dip. Buying up the etf with 5k in my roth seems like a good idea. what do u guys think?",

If I'm running Blackrock, I want total control of crypto prices, and total insight into everyone's crypto trades. Defi traders exist outside of the KYC financial system. Therefore it makes sense for Wall Street to shake out these Defi traders with huge moves. All price charts on Friday have giant dips which look artificial. It appears the order books were exhausted by massive volume, likely trading bots. Is there in fact a rivalry between Defi and Wall Street?",

        "title": "10 Reasons Elon Musk Is Satoshi Nakamoto And Why Staying Anonymous Was His Ultimate Power Move",
        "selftext": "By: J E N S E N\n\nForget the tired myth of a reclusive Japanese cryptographer. The true identity of Bitcoin\u2019s creator might be hiding in plain sight \u2014 billionaire innovator, Elon Musk. More than just a tech genius, Musk may have created Bitcoin as his magnum opus, a digital revolution and power move born from betrayal, vision, and defiance.\n\nHere\u2019s how he could\u2019ve built Bitcoin from the bones of PayPal, ghosted the world, and delivered the most powerful \u201cEFF-YOU\u201d in modern history.\n\n1. PayPal Was the Prototype for Bitcoin\n\nBefore Bitcoin, there was PayPal. And before PayPal became a household name, Elon Musk was one of its most radical visionaries.\n\nIn the late 1990s Musk launched Zip2 and then X.com \u2014 platforms built to digitize commerce and finance. He argued for an internet-native monetary platform that would remove the middlemen. That pitch didn\u2019t sit well with all of PayPal\u2019s stakeholders, and in 2000 he was effectively pushed out of the company he\u2019d helped create. The outcome was a corporate PayPal that scaled beautifully \u2014 but one that had lost the radical decentralization Musk had envisioned.\n\nThink about that for a moment. He had the blueprint for moving value on the internet. He watched that blueprint morph into a conservative payment processor controlled by boards and investors. For someone who thinks in systems and first principles, losing the narrative on money would be more than a setback \u2014 it would sting. Bitcoin reads like someone finishing that original vision: peer-to-peer payments, cryptographic proof in place of trust, and no boardroom to water it down. If you are looking for the prototype that would naturally evolve into Bitcoin, PayPal \u2014 and Musk\u2019s contributions to its early thinking \u2014 are the obvious origin.\n\n2. Bitcoin Was the Revenge Plot\n\nThe PayPal aftermath produced a famous phenomenon: the PayPal Mafia \u2014 a constellation of founders and investors who parlayed that company into multiple Silicon Valley empires. Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, Max Levchin and others shaped a post-PayPal world full of boards, venture money and corporate safety. Musk felt sidelined by many who later prospered.\n\nIf you were Musk \u2014 brilliant, proud, and scorned \u2014 how would you respond? One plausible, delicious option: build the same thing again, but in a form that cannot be owned or sued into oblivion. Bitcoin \u2014 decentralized, open-source, leaderless \u2014 is literally the strategic revenge: the concept of online money reborn where no board can convene to change the plan, and no single person can be targeted for control.\n\nThis isn\u2019t revenge in the petty sense. It\u2019s revenge by design. The kind where you build a system so resilient that your rivals can\u2019t litigate, buy, or commandeer it. That\u2019s the level of escalation you would expect from someone who was kicked out of his own prior revolution.\n\n3. Bitcoin\u2019s Language Matches Musk\u2019s Style\n\nWords matter. Satoshi\u2019s white paper and forum posts are short, precise, occasionally sarcastic, and relentlessly focused on solving systemic trust problems in finance. \n\nMusk\u2019s public voice \u2014 his blog posts from the early X.com days, his technical talks, his late-night tweets \u2014 often mirrors that tone: blunt, technical, lightly sardonic, and obsessed with systems-level fixes.\n\nThere\u2019s one Satoshi line people keep quoting:\n\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure\u2026 make it about the open source project and give more credit to your dev contributors.\u201d\n\nThat sentence ticks a lot of Musk boxes. He\u2019s publicly released Tesla patents to encourage industry progress. He frames projects as a mission, not a personal brand. He hates unhelpful media narratives. \n\nSatoshi\u2019s rhetoric elevates code and contributors over cults of personality \u2014 a point Musk has repeatedly made in other contexts. Stylometry isn\u2019t a smoking gun, but when the rhetorical DNA lines up across mission, disdain for celebrity, and open-source evangelism, the parallel becomes at least eyebrow-raising.\n\n4. Musk Lives Like Someone Who Doesn\u2019t Need the Money\n\nOne of the most unnerving anomalies about Satoshi is the untouched holdings: an estimated ~1 million BTC mined early and never spent. That\u2019s not merely frugality; it\u2019s a deliberate signal. A person who could have cashed out decades ago and instead chose absolute silence was either dead, unwilling to hand off the keys, or actively demonstrating that wealth wasn\u2019t the point.\n\nThat latter profile matches Musk. He\u2019s publicly sold homes, scaled back personal possessions, and repeatedly frames his agenda as mission-driven rather than wealth-driven. You don\u2019t have to be wealthy to treat wealth as irrelevant \u2014 you just have to be someone for whom impact matters more than consumption. \n\nIf Satoshi wanted to make a point \u2014 that he created a system and didn\u2019t need to siphon the value off for personal gain \u2014 leaving the stash intact would be the ultimate statement. Musk has shown again and again that his compass points to scale and legacy over ostentatious consumption.\n\n5. Scottie Pippen\u2019s 1993 Claim Is a Strange, Useful Breadcrumb\n\nThis is where the theory becomes juicy. NBA legend Scottie Pippen made a public remark about meeting someone connected to Satoshi back in the early 1990s. On its face it\u2019s bizarre: Bitcoin hadn\u2019t been invented then. But if you accept that proto-ideas, conversations about digital money, and early cryptography brainstorms circulated in tech circles long before 2008, the statement becomes plausible context rather than fantasy.\n\nPippen spent time on the West Coast during his post-Bulls career. He later launched a token called $BALL and publicly referenced the meeting without the kind of social-media takedown you\u2019d expect if he\u2019d been inventing drama. If someone with Pippen\u2019s platform casually mentions meeting a future Bitcoin architect and walks away unscathed, either he was telling the literal truth, or the person he met had leverage or influence over the narrative \u2014 influence consistent with a tech titan who could arrange silence.\n\nThat\u2019s a loaded clue, not a conclusion. But it fits the timeline: Musk was involved in Bay Area tech throughout the 1990s and early 2000s; Pippen had West Coast exposure; the idea of a confidential pitch to a wealthy athlete or an NDA sealed with future upside is not farfetched for stealth R&D.\n\n6. Musk\u2019s Tweets Are All Performance, Few Confirmations\n\nElon\u2019s social media is a hall of mirrors: teasing, trolling, and occasionally revealing. He drops hints \u2014 \u201cBitcoin is interesting,\u201d \u201cSatoshi deserves credit\u201d \u2014 while refusing to take responsibility or push narratives too far. His tweets create plausible deniability and fan speculation without landing on confession.\n\nThat\u2019s a classic technique for someone who wants to seed ideas in public without exposing themselves to legal or reputational risk. If Musk was Satoshi, he could enjoy the cultural resonance without ever signing his name. Tweeting teases keeps the conversation alive and maintains the mystique \u2014 letting markets, myths, and media do the heavy lifting.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of tangle only someone comfortable with theater and ambiguity would orchestrate, and Musk\u2019s career has been threaded with precisely that mixture.\n\n7. The Genesis Block\u2019s Hidden Message Feels Deliberate \u2014 and Personal\n\nSatoshi didn\u2019t just publish code; he planted a manifesto. The Genesis Block contains the headline: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d That is not merely timestamping a moment in history. It\u2019s a political and moral critique, a one-line statement of intent: this project exists because the old systems are brittle and corruptible.\n\nMusk\u2019s biography is a litany of projects aimed at attacking perceived centralization and inefficiency \u2014 rockets to break aerospace monopolies, electric cars to disrupt oil, satellites to decentralize internet access. Bitcoin\u2019s opening salvo reads like a direct hit on the financial establishment \u2014 the perfect fit for an engineer who builds disruptive infrastructure as moral argument. The Genesis Block is a founding manifesto that matches the rest of Musk\u2019s playbook.\n\n8. Vanishing Into Myth Was a Strategic Move \u2014 Not an Accident\n\nIf you wanted to create the most resilient piece of infrastructure, would you sign your name? Probably not. A leader\u2019s presence creates vulnerabilities: legal targets, political pressure, an ability to be negotiated with or coerced. Satoshi\u2019s choice to disappear \u2014 to let the protocol and community shoulder the future \u2014 removed the single greatest point of failure.\n\nFor someone with Musk\u2019s temperament \u2014 famously willing to burn boards, ignore PR, and ruffle institutions \u2014 stepping away fits. It also guarantees the legend: an anonymous creator is more powerful as idea than as human, because humans die, get compromised, and are vulnerable. The myth is invulnerable. The myth shapes the market and the movement. If Musk is the author, stepping into the shadows was the most tactical, effective posture available.\n\n9. Anonymity Neutralized Legal Threats from Powerful Enemies\n\nThere was another, very practical reason to stay anonymous: lawsuits. If Bitcoin was in any way perceived as derivative of PayPal\u2019s architecture or ideas, declaring authorship could have invited sizeable litigation from the PayPal alumni and their legal firepower. Lawsuits would have been an existential risk to the project and, certainly, a personal liability.\n\nAnonymity preempted lawsuits the way a moat preempts siege engines. It prevented courts from easily assigning a defendant, and by the time Bitcoin achieved global adoption, no single party could be prosecuted in a way that rewound the network. If you\u2019re trying to build a system that outlasts coercion, staying off the scoreboard is the smartest defense. Musk has history of tangling with regulators; he also has the heuristic to avoid battles where the gain is small and the strategic angle is large.\n\n10. Only Elon Has the Tools, the Motive, and the Means\n\nThis is the simple checklist argument. Building Bitcoin required rare combinations: technical fluency in programming and cryptography, experience with online payment systems and design of resilient networks, the capital to prototype in stealth, and a motive to blow up the old order. It also required the kind of audacity to release it and walk away.\n\nPlenty of brilliant crypto minds could fit parts of that description. Nick Szabo, Hal Finney, and others have credible claims on technical grounds. But few have the combination of motive (being ousted from a money project), scale (post-PayPal capital and reach), and performative temperament (a love for dramatic strategic moves) like Musk.\n\nIf you believe the origin story requires more than just technical skill \u2014 if you believe it required a certain ruthlessness and long-term strategic thinking \u2014 then Musk is uniquely plausible. He had the itch, the resources, and the grudge to not only imagine a different financial system but to bring it into being in a way that could not be easily hijacked, sued, or tamed.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nThis isn\u2019t proof. It\u2019s a case: a pattern of motive, means, style, and strategic behavior that, when viewed end-to-end, forms a credible narrative. You can take any of these nodes alone \u2014 the PayPal origins, the Genesis Block jab, the silence, the Pippen anecdote \u2014 and call it coincidence. \n\nPut them together, though, and the theory becomes coherent, stubborn, and (for many) persuasive. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the biggest factor of all: Musk had the knowledge to pull it off because he could back-engineer it from his experience with PayPal. The revenge against PayPal is one thing, but taking their knowledge, rebuilding it into something newer and better, and never saying a word? That\u2019s priceless. It\u2019s the kind of ultimate counter-move only Musk would see as both justice and genius. If Elon Musk is Satoshi, then\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t merely a technological breakthrough. It\u2019s a revenge play, a masterclass in game theory, and the most audacious strategic flex of the internet age. And whether he did it or not, the story tells us something about the age of systems: the person who learns to build infrastructure and then walk away may be the most powerful kind of architect of all.\n\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAndresen, Gavin.

        "selftext": "**Preamble:**  \nWelcome to our first major CCMOON DAO update! We\u2019re thrilled to share some important changes and directions that will strengthen our community and ensure a sustainable future for MOON holders.\n\nFirst and foremost, this week marks an important milestone: our DAO officer elections (posting shortly). We have vacant officer positions, and to fill them, we\u2019re allowing members who don\u2019t meet the usual 50,000 MOON requirement to step up and apply. This is a great opportunity for more of you to get involved in leadership and help shape the DAO.\n\nWe\u2019ve also just completed our first full month of our new revenue share model. We\u2019ve added nearly $4,500 to the treasury directly from that revenue, and this is just the beginning. Our main future goal is to formally become a Marshall Islands DAO, or MIDAO, and that\u2019s our top priority. We want everyone to be clear on that direction as we move forward.\n\nIn addition to this main goal, we have other initiatives on the horizon, like integrating a DEX on our website and expanding our presence beyond Reddit. We\u2019ll list these out in the detailed updates below, but we wanted to call out these major goals first so everyone understands the big picture.\n\nNow, let\u2019s dive into the specifics:\n\n**1. General Overview and useful links**\n\nWe\u2019ve been actively building the foundation for the DAO to grow and expand for some time.

I\u2019m not sure if they use BTC for purchases. I myself am also invested in BTC\n\nI\u2019ve seen the ledger wallets but what I can\u2019t find is if an account is required? I\u2019d really like to just hand over a hard wallet with the codes. Is that possible? If not, are there any physical secure wallets that can achieve this? \n\nAny additional advice would be appreciated \n\nThank you! ",

        "title": "Interesting (to me) of my first and only Bitcoin small BTC purchases in 2016.",
        "selftext": "Interesting Bitcoin discussion.  All numbers are accurate.\n\nOdd start to the story.\n\nNearly everyone in my extended family has significant hair loss, other than my father.  I'm a numbers guy, so I decided years ago to begin using Propecia for hair loss in order to preserve what I had.\n\nI discovered that Proscar (5mg) has the same ingredients as Propecia (1mg) and the price was about the same.  But obviously, with Proscar, you get 5x as much product.  So I decided to buy Proscar and cut them into quarters.  Thus, I'd get 400 \"tablets\" for the price of 100 tablets.\n\nJust one problem.  Proscar is only prescribed for prostate enlargement, and I don't have that.  So I decided to buy from a reputable overseas (Vanuatu) pharmacy for a good price.\n\nBecause they were selling prescription drugs without a prescription, the authorities went after them.\n\nFirst they closed their dot com address, so they had to a Vanuatu address (I think dot vu).\n\nNext, they cancelled their ability to receive credit card payments, so I used PayPal.\n\nFinally, the only form of payment they could accept was Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin?  What the heck is that?!\n\nSo figured out how to buy it to pay for my Proscar.\n\nOn September 9, 2016, I bought 0.0922 BTC for $59.98.\n\nOn September 10, I bought 0.072 BTC for $47.00.\n\nOn September 10, they gave me 0.016 BTC for opening a new account, then worth $10.\n\nAlso on September 10, I sent 0.121 BTC for $75.71 to pay for the Proscar.\n\nThe next year, I needed more Proscar, and thought I was going to need more Bitcoin.  But I was surprised to see that it had appreciated enough for me to pay them 0.0506 BTC on July 27, 2017, then worth $136.80.\n\nSo my total out-of-pocket purchases were $106.98.\n\nHad I not used the BTC to pay for the Proscar, the current value would be just under $21,000.  So a percentage increase in 10 years of 15,250%. \n\nRemember that out of my $106.98 purchases, I paid out $212.51 during 2016 and 2017.\n\nEven though I paid out almost all of it, the residual balance is still worth nearly $1,000, so not bad but it could have been a lot more.\n\nI've received a lot of calls on Bitcoin over the years.  Usually they come after Bitcoin has made a huge run to the upside, and often it has dropped a lot after I got those calls.  But I usually tell people that it is a volatile asset, be careful about buying after a big run up, and not to buy more than they can afford to lose, since it can move around a lot.\n\nHere's a copy/paste of my purchases.\n\nJuly 2017\n\nBTC\n\nSent BTC\n\n\\-$136.80\n\n\\-0.0506 BTC\n\nJul 27, 2017\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nBTC\n\nSent BTC\n\n\\-$75.71\n\n\\-0.121 BTC\n\nSep 10, 2016\n\nBTC\n\nReceived BTC\n\n\\+$10.00\n\n\\+0.016 BTC\n\nSep 10, 2016\n\nBTC\n\nBought BTC\n\n\\+$47.00\n\n\\+0.072 BTC\n\nSep 10, 2016\n\nBTC\n\nBought BTC\n\n\\+$59.98\n\n\\+0.0922 BTC\n\nSep 9, 2016",
