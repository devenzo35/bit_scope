            "selftext": "tl;dr\n\n* Calastone, with \u00a3250B+ monthly, will launch tokenized fund share classes on Polygon\n* Integration brings onchain fund distribution to 4.5k financial institutions in 58 markets\n* Polygon\u2019s sub-cent fees and near-instant finality make large-scale institutional settlement practical onchain\n* Calastone is a major step toward bringing onchain capital markets built on scalable, transparent infrastructure\n\nCalastone, the global funds network that processes more than \u00a3250 billion in transactions each month, is launching its tokenized fund distribution solution on Polygon, the go-to stack powering global money movement, supporting sending billions in value, instantly. \n\nThe integration brings institutional-scale fund distribution onchain, enabling asset managers to operate fund share classes directly over blockchain rails while maintaining the administrative and compliance processes they already use. \n\nThis marks one of the first large-scale integrations of blockchain into global fund infrastructure. Calastone\u2019s adoption of Polygon provides a model for how tokenization can modernize asset distribution. With Polgyon\u2019s rails, Calastone reduces intermediaries, expands cross-border access, and enhances transparency without disrupting compliance or custody standards.\n\nPolygon delivers the scale, Ethereum compatibility, and cost efficiency that global institutions need to operate onchain, without sacrificing trust or performance.\n\nBy launching tokenized fund share classes on Polygon, Calastone unlocks new pathways for both institutional and retail investors. Asset managers can reach digital-first investor pools globally, while blockchain transparency and automation simplify settlement and reconciliation across jurisdictions.\n\nThe integration also signals a broader shift underway: the migration of traditional capital markets onto public, open infrastructure. As Polygon\u2019s Rio and Heimdall upgrades bring speeds of up to 5,000 TPS and instant finality, the network continues to position itself as the go-to chain for institutional-grade payments and tokenized assets.\n\nCalastone\u2019s Tokenised Distribution is now live, with expanded functionality and network integrations planned throughout 2025, a milestone that takes a major step to bring the future of fund management onchain.",

As I sit here now though, I really wish I would have just used that money on more stock market investments and diversified more into precious metals. I'm watching the McRib predicting our markets and looking at speculative trend graphs that are more abstract than horoscope sky charting while countries start to ramp up gold purchasing to protect themselves from economic volatility.

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been reflecting on the current state of both the stock market and Bitcoin, and I wanted to get some thoughts from this community.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing conversation, both among professional investors and everyday people, that the stock market is overvalued. Many feel it\u2019s due for a significant correction\u2014or even a full-blown crash. Meanwhile, Bitcoin seems to be going through changes as well. Longtime members of the community often say it\u2019s not what it used to be, with new investors panicking over 20% drops and large financial institutions showing off holdings in ways that feel like clear market manipulation\u2014especially in recent months with all the pump-and-dump activity.\n\nI recently watched a video where a financial advisor made a point I found interesting: the stock market measures how the wealthy are doing, while the economy measures how the average blue-collar worker is doing. Looking at both, it seems like the wealthy are growing exponentially, while the middle class is disappearing.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m curious about:\n\t\u2022\tDo you think Bitcoin will ever return the kind of gains it once did?\n\t\u2022\tIs the stock market actually overvalued, or are we just witnessing the rich getting richer while the rest of us struggle?\n\t\u2022\tIs this the \u201cnew America,\u201d where the middle class has effectively vanished?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your practical takes\u2014no hype, just real perspectives.\n\nYes, I used AI to help me put this together, but these are my thoughts.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I'm a beginner and I'm planning to get a Trezor Safe 7 soon. I've been thinking about good security management and would like you to review/expand my idea for potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nI'm grateful for any feedback, so thank you in advance for taking the time! Hard wallet model: Trezor Safe 7 (Bitcoin-only version)\n\n\n\nStructure summary:\n\n\n\nTrezor Safe 7 Standard Wallet (24 words) | Trade Account: This wallet is used to process all external transactions, e.g., receiving payments from/to third parties, or deposits/withdrawals at cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n\n\nTrezor Safe 7 Passphrase Wallet (25 words) | Hold Account: This wallet is solely for storing Bitcoin. No external transactions are permitted, neither receiving nor sending Bitcoin. The only allowed transactions are sending and receiving funds to/from the trade account.\n\n\n\nAll funds to be sent or received must go through the trading account. Upon receiving funds, they are transferred from the trading account to the holding account.\n\n\n\nHere, I would also use a passphrase that I definitely cannot remember and keep separately on a metal plate in a separate location, not where my seed phrase is stored, to prevent theft of both the seed phrase and the passphrase.\n\n\n\nStoring the passphrase separately has the advantage for me that I can never move assets from the holding account at short notice, as I would first have to travel to another location to retrieve them, since the passphrase is required to authorize payments. This limits the usability of my holding account, but I actually prefer that, as I don't plan to access my holdings for at least 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nStoring the passphrase separately has the advantage for me that I can never move assets from the holding account at short notice, as I would first have to travel to another location to retrieve them, since the passphrase is required to authorize payments. This limits the usability of my holding account, but I actually find that beneficial, as I don't plan to access my holdings for at least 10 years.\n\n\n\nAdditional Security Measures:\n\n\n\n\\- Only enter the passphrase using Trezor Safe 7 during account creation to prevent compromise on the computer during entry (e.g., keyloggers).\n\n\n\nGeneral Security Rules:\n\n\n\n\\- Never store the seed phrase digitally (no digital notes or photos, such as \"keep your key offline\").\n\n\n\n\\- Store the seed phrase in metal (likely using Trezor Keep Metal) and keep the passphrase securely stored, but in a different location than the seed phrase.\n\n\n\n\\- Never share the public key (XPUB) to prevent all account activity from being traced.\n\n\n\nI put a lot of effort into writing this, and perhaps it will be helpful to others. You would greatly appreciate it if you would take the time to review my structure and share any suggestions for improvement or report any security vulnerabilities.",

            "selftext": "Warren Buffett has argued that Bitcoin isn\u2019t an investment but a gamble, because it produces no cash flow. People buy it only to sell it later for a higher price. An investment, in his view, means owning a productive asset\u2014like Coca-Cola\u2014that generates steady income.\n\nBut here\u2019s what he misses:  \nBitcoin is neither an investment nor a gamble \u2014 it\u2019s money.  \nUnlike fiat currencies, it cannot be diluted, which means it can serve as a long-term savings instrument without anyone being able to debase it. That\u2019s all there is to it.\n\nWill its price rise or fall in the future? No one knows\u2014just as no one can know the future value of Coca-Cola or any other asset. The only certain fact about Bitcoin is that its supply cannot be diluted, and for me that\u2019s enough, because I understand how money works. Fortunately, more and more people are beginning to see that\u2014especially in countries suffering from high inflation, where Bitcoin isn\u2019t a luxury but a basic necessity for anyone with savings.  \nBottom line: Coca-Cola is a gamble; Bitcoin is money.  \nI don\u2019t claim to understand investments, but I do care about saving for the future \u2014 and common sense tells me to do that using a currency with a built-in supply limit.",

It\u2019s been amazing watching how far things have come, especially seeing how much more awareness and accessibility there is today compared to when I started.\n\nThat said, I had an interesting chat recently with a friend who works at a large, very public company in the same industry. He mentioned that, in his view, maybe only 3\u20135% of people worldwide have actually adopted or used Bitcoin or crypto in any meaningful way.\n\nIt surprised me a bit part of me feels like adoption is much wider now, but maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m surrounded by people who are deep into the space.\n\nWhat do you all think? Are we still early, or are those numbers about right?\n",

            "selftext": "Chinas National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center dropped a bombshell report accusing the US government of stealing 127k Bitcoin worth around 13 billion dollars. This is getting geopolitical fast.\n\nThe Bitcoin was originally stolen from Chinas LuBian mining pool back in December 2020. At the time it was worth about 3.5 billion but the hack did not get much mainstream attention. The coins then sat in the attacker\u2019s wallets for years and only started moving in mid 2024 before ending up in addresses that analysts and China\u2019s report now link to US authorities, and that the DOJ says it controls as of the seizure announced in October 2025.\n\nChinas argument is that normal criminals would cash out immediately. The fact these coins stayed dormant for about four years points to a state level operation not some random hacker looking for quick profit. They say the sophistication of the hack and the long dormancy proves it was government orchestrated.\n\nThe US Department of Justice seized the Bitcoin in October 2025 as part of a case against Chen Zhi who ran Cambodias Prince Group. They charged him with running a massive crypto fraud and forced labor scam network and said the seizure was a lawful criminal proceeds forfeiture. The DOJ has explicitly denied China\u2019s \u201cstate level hack\u201d accusation and says it had no involvement in the original theft.\n\nHeres the thing tho. Chen Zhi apparently sent multiple messages on chain basically begging the hackers to return the Bitcoin and offering ransom. The hackers never responded which is weird if they were just criminals.\n\nThis batch of Bitcoin now represents about 39% of all BTC held by the US government based on on chain tracking of US controlled addresses. Trump recently said the US is far ahead of China in crypto adoption so this accusation comes at a politically charged moment.\n\nWhether China has real evidence or this is just geopolitical posturing nobody knows yet. But it could spark what some analysts are already calling a crypto cold war between the two superpowers.",

            "title": "MegaETH Revokes Crypto Influencer $1M Token Allocation Over Hedging Tweet",
            "selftext": "What\u2019s crypto without a little bit of drama? \n\nMegaETH, an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, has revoked a nearly $1 million token allocation from prominent crypto influencer icobeast. The decision stemmed from a public tweet where he expressed interest in hedging his position, which violated the project's strict ICO terms.\n\nSo this will be confusing as the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is similar to the influencer\u2019s name (icobeast). I will do my best to refer to the influencer with his full name. \n\nFor background on the ICO: MegaETH's public token sale ran from October 28 to October 31, 2025, offering 500 million MEGA tokens, which was 5% of the total 10 billion supply, at a valuation that attracted over $1.4 billion in commitments for just $50 million worth of tokens, resulting in a staggering 28x oversubscription. Icobeast, a well-known figure in the space for his airdrop farming guides, reviews of projects, and history of securing large allocations in high-profile launches, was awarded a significant portion valued at approximately $1 million based on pre-market pricing.\n\nThe terms of the ICO were clear and uncompromising: Participants agreed to a one-year lock-up period on their tokens, with explicit prohibitions against any form of hedging, shorting, or over-the-counter (OTC) trading. Additionally, the agreement barred public statements on social media or elsewhere discussing intentions to sell, hedge, or otherwise mitigate risk, as these could undermine the project's goal of fostering long-term commitment from holders rather than short-term speculators.\n\nThe trigger was icobeast\u2019s tweet on November 9, 2025: \u201cAt current pre-market prices my MegaETH ICO allocation is worth nearly $1 million dollars. I need to figure out how to hedge this.\u201d The post went viral within crypto circles, amassing thousands of likes and replies debating the ethics of such transparency. Less than 24 hours later, icobeast followed up with: \u201cMy allocation has been revoked and is now worth $0,\u201d confirming that MegaETH had enforced the clause by issuing a full refund and reallocating the tokens to other eligible participants.\n\nThis isn't the first sign of MegaETH's rigorous approach. MegaETH has emphasized building a \"real-time\" blockchain ecosystem free from the dump-and-run dynamics that plague many token launches. By revoking the allocation, they aimed to preserve scarcity and align incentives with genuine builders and users.\n\nMegaETH tried to incorporate social scoring and reputation metrics like Ethos into its ICO allocation process to prioritize \"conviction\" over speculation. Allocations in the \"Conviction Round\" were determined algorithmically using onchain activity, wallet age, lock-up commitments, and reputation signals from platforms like Ethos and Kaito, alongside NFT holdings in the MegaETH ecosystem such as Fluffle and Bad Bunnz.\n\nEthos, a decentralized reputation protocol, assigns trust scores based on on-chain behavior, social contributions, and community feedback, categorizing users as \"trusted,\" \"neutral,\" or \"untrusted.\" MegaETH weighted these scores alongside other data to filter for long-term holders, enforcing a one-year lock-up, no-hedging policy, and bans on public discussions of selling or risk mitigation.\n\nicobeast entered with a high Ethos score reflecting positive on-chain engagement and social influence. This earned him an initial allocation valued at nearly $1 million at pre-market prices, positioning him as a top recipient under the system's metrics.\n\nIn stark contrast, influencer KookCapitalLLC, who\u2019s known for rugging her followers, received a 94% allocation on her maximum $186,282 bid. This netted her $174,490 to purchase 1,746,644 MEGA tokens. Her Ethos score sits at 357, firmly in the \"untrusted\" tier, stemming from documented patterns of high-volume sales post-hype and public disputes, including rejecting KOL deals and score manipulation allegations.\n\nThis has become become super controversial as some praised MegaETH for upholding rules in an oversubscribed sale, others pointed out how a high-reputation participant with a clean Ethos profile loses out over a hypothetical statement, while a low-score figure with a history of alleged follower dumps secures whale status.\n\nYet another tale of crypto drama \n",

            "title": "Biggest Strength of Bitcoin. Biggest Problem in Bitcoin",
            "selftext": "8 years had passed since BTC/BCH fork. For 8 years two branches of Bitcoin exist and tick along: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. As I was watching it unfold for pretty long time, I held assumptions that right now I deem as mistakes. And also for the longest time when I was asked about Bitcoin, I was descrining its strengths a bit different than I do now. Let me articulate some thoughts\n\nBiggest strength for what? I argue: for savings. From the dawn of the Internet I used a lot of payment systems, and some of the solutions that exist right now satisfy my requirements for payments almost completely, most of them are centralized and some are not like BCH. So, having thought carefully about it recently, I am not in agreement anymore with many BCH proponents (and with Satoshi) that payments is the core of open blockchain tech that was created in 2009 or even a bigger part of it. Satoshi was addressing bailouts in Genesis block, also he put then and most of the people put since very big emphasis on supply limit\n\n**Biggest strength of Bitcoin is its specific digital nature**. It has several characteristics that puts it over fiat, physical or digial, gold (and other metals) and tokens of other chains launched after Bitcoin\n\nThose are, in concentric circles:\n\n* supply cap and nature of mining - puts it over fiat, limit and who gets new coins\n\n* digitalness, incospicousness, multisignability - puts it over gold - ease of crossing borders, of resisting govt aggression, of storing savings in an invisible manner, of trustlessly locking funds, the pathway to a world with little-to-no-theft of savings\n\n* energy signature and network effect - puts it over all PoW chains and all non-PoW chains - in case of contention I can fallback to heaviest chain instead of choosing whom to trust on social media (BCH is steaily losing ground here for now as it gets relatively lighter and lighter vs BTC as BCH slowly loses in network effect zero-sum game). Bitcoin is most decentralized and most secure that it has every beeng: most efficient mining machines most closely distributed to global capital, ~800 equivalent PoW days of billions worth of hardware - measure of security\n\n**Biggest problem in Bitcoin is the secure management of private keys**, Not fess in USD equivalent. For the longest time I was missing it, but now more carefully looked at on-chain numbers of both chains: fork dot lol, coin dot dance, bitinfocharts dot com and others - I think I was wrong back then. Both BTC and BCH are heavily custodied not for some conspiratorial reasons, but because massed of people who are flocking to crypto to save purchasing power from inflation can't or don't want to figure out key management - so they voluntarily reintroduce 3rd party trust and risks back in\n\nSo, BCH hasn't solved biggest problem. Not back at the fork, not in years still. I like ASERT and ABLA, clever dynamic metrics are much better than some constants. I like that fractional satoshis and quantum-proof signing are being discussed at BitcoinCashResearch. These two are indeed most dangerous among most discusesed technical problems remaining. I don't care much about smart contracts (as I deem payments issues are red-herring and, not unlikely - way to sell unbaked ideas to VCs) - I don't place high urgenty on improving on-chain math on BCH or elsewhere. But BCH did nothing to address management of keys\n\nIn principal it could be solved with: software, hardware or networks. I don't see hardware wallets as the solution: a device is not inconspicous, could provide false sense of security if mishandled (google IronKey 8 attempts out of 10), approach has bad trust model (trusting the manufacturer, worse if a natural monopoly with economies of scale will appear) and still singlesign as most realized. Singlesign puts everything on the line at specific points: malware or user mistake - and coins are gone (contracts only worsen the risk model). I am not smart enough to imagine a software solution\n\nSo. my **call to action** to address the biggest problem in Bitcoin is to demand from the market (especially from current cryptobanks): shift from singlesign 3rd party custody to multisging 3rd party custody. Say, client prepares address with a cryptobank and an escrow and funds it after, then coins only could be spent 2-of-3 when 1 of 2 is the client's key (plus timelocks, plus all clever stuff etc). Rare careful transactions of managing savings - much like managing stock papers through brokers or going to a bank in old days, but with all benefits of multisging. As I see it this could more or less eliminate theft of savings by private or state criminals alike\n\nI think that insisting that BCH is better than BTC purely on fees and would switch to BCH happen that everyone would live happily ever after - misses this problem, and could be in itself part of the reason BCH is losing its network effect. And BTC proponents are having their inconsequaential beef right now. Both communities (public forums, Reddit/BitcoinTalk/X/Telegram) are blinded and/or confused, so to speak\n\nI self-custody. I use coin control. I use all iterations of money tech: fiat, metals, crypto - for risk management and for various goals. I don't expect majority to be like me. If I am wrong, one is most welcome to tell me why. I need correct model of reality",

As someone who is also wanting to do that I was curious what others were doing to accomplish their goal? Of course there are options like setting recurring investments but I am looking for/interested in the other ways people are going about doing this. \n\nFor me I mostly use my Fold card because I am able to set it to auto purchase for me and I'm able to get sats back on purchases and gift cards.\n\nI'm curious on if anyone is using anything else or if they have any tips or tricks! Thank you in advance! ",

And then even that answer got down votes.\n\nThere are still lots of people that just hate the fact that someone brings up the crypto question. I'm sure you have met some that just roll their eyes as soon as you mention it. There will always be people critisizing your move if it's not what the majority of the crowd is doing. If it's not approved by everyone, that means it's bad. I bet there are still a lot of people that still think Bitcoin and crypto is made for illegal transactions and should be banned.\n\nI read a book recently where during the industrial revolution, there were workers required to do the work. Soon after, those people were replaced my the machines that not only can do the work faster and better, they cost a fraction of what a person was paid. As a result, those angry workers formed a union and started breaking into the factories at night, and breaking down the machines. In some case setting up fire. Eventually some of them were hanged and a decade later, the machines replaced workers. There will always be the stubborn ones that think this is the way world is now and it will not change, everything is perfect the way it is now.\n\nEither you adapt or you will be left behind.\n\nIt's good to have a good community like this. It's encouraging. \n\nThank you all!",

            "selftext": "Chinas National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center dropped a bombshell report accusing the US government of stealing 127k Bitcoin worth around 13 billion dollars. This is getting geopolitical fast.\n\nThe Bitcoin was originally stolen from Chinas LuBian mining pool back in December 2020. At the time it was worth about 3.5 billion but the hack did not get much mainstream attention. The coins then sat in the attacker\u2019s wallets for years and only started moving in mid 2024 before ending up in addresses that analysts and China\u2019s report now link to US authorities, and that the DOJ says it controls as of the seizure announced in October 2025.\n\nChinas argument is that normal criminals would cash out immediately. The fact these coins stayed dormant for about four years points to a state level operation not some random hacker looking for quick profit. They say the sophistication of the hack and the long dormancy proves it was government orchestrated.\n\nThe US Department of Justice seized the Bitcoin in October 2025 as part of a case against Chen Zhi who ran Cambodias Prince Group. They charged him with running a massive crypto fraud and forced labor scam network and said the seizure was a lawful criminal proceeds forfeiture. The DOJ has explicitly denied China\u2019s \u201cstate level hack\u201d accusation and says it had no involvement in the original theft.\n\nHeres the thing tho. Chen Zhi apparently sent multiple messages on chain basically begging the hackers to return the Bitcoin and offering ransom. The hackers never responded which is weird if they were just criminals.\n\nThis batch of Bitcoin now represents about 39% of all BTC held by the US government based on on chain tracking of US controlled addresses. Trump recently said the US is far ahead of China in crypto adoption so this accusation comes at a politically charged moment.\n\nWhether China has real evidence or this is just geopolitical posturing nobody knows yet. But it could spark what some analysts are already calling a crypto cold war between the two superpowers.",

            "selftext": "It's been said many times before, but now it's official: the EU isn't fighting financial crime. It's fighting financial freedom.\n\nYou've probably already heard that starting 2027, the new AML rules will make it illegal to use more than \u20ac10K in cash, and you'll need to show ID for anything over \u20ac3K. They're calling it \"anti\u2013money laundering\". I call it what it really is - the slow suffocation of privacy, disguised as protection.\n\nCash is being phased out, step by step, in the name of \"security\". The timing isn't random either - the Digital Euro is next, and it's coming around 2029. Christine Lagarde and the ECB want you to believe it's about \"innovation\" and \"efficiency\". Right... only, programmable money means programmable control. It means every cent you spend will be logged, filtered and analyzed. It means one flick of a switch could freeze your funds if you say, buy or donate to the \"wrong\" thing.\n\nAnd here's the part nobody's really talking about - because it hasn't made the headlines yet. Once the Digital Euro and the Digital ID system (the EUDI Wallet) are fully rolled out, you'll need your verified Digital ID to buy or hold Bitcoin legally on any EU-compliant exchange. That's baked into MiCA, TFR and eIDAS 2.0 or in short - No ID, no Bitcoin.\n\nThey can't ban BTC outright - that would wake too many people up. So instead, they'll lock it behind KYC walls, tie your wallet to your identity and make \"unregistered\" transactions suspicious by default. You'll \"own\" Bitcoin, but only through their system; verified through their wallet; Approved by their standards; Logged in their database - all under the illusion of safety and compliance.\n\nThis is why the time to stack is now. Before the walls go up. Before \"non-compliant wallets\" become a red flag. Before the Digital Euro becomes your default wallet - whether you like it or not. Once the Digital Euro replaces physical cash, Bitcoin will be the only truly free money left. It's the only network that doesn't care about passports, permissions or delusional policies.\n\nIf you're in Europe, this is your warning shot. The choice isn't between fiat and crypto anymore - it's between freedom and obedience. Once money becomes a monitoring tool, you'll never get that privacy back.\n\nSo stack while you still can. Stack quietly. Be smart about where and how you grow your holdings - for example if you keep it on N\u0435\u0445\u043e, you'll earn yield on idle BTC while accumulating, then move to self-custody when the time's right. Every extra sat counts when you're stacking against a system designed to box you in.\n\nWhen the new rules kick in and they announce that you'll need your \u201cverified Digital ID\u201d to buy Bitcoin, remember this moment. The EU wants to own you... And Bitcoin is your last exit before the gate closes!",

            "selftext": "The infamous \"Uptober Fk up\" was a brutal gut-check. Instead of the expected rally, October 2025 broke a seven-year bullish streak, triggering a flash crash and a massive wave of liquidations that sent prices tumbling from all-time highs of over $126,000 to dip below the $100,000 psychological barrier. This panic-selling washed out huge amounts of leverage and shattered retail confidence, pushing the market into \"Extreme Fear.\"  \nSo why buy now? Because this is precisely the kind of capitulation that long-term bulls look for.\nThis wasn't a fundamental failure of the network; it was a technical, leverage-driven shakeout. The core arguments for Bitcoin remain unchanged. We're seeing institutional investors hold steady, refusing to panic-sell. The recent dip was a stress test, and the $100k level, while breached, has shown significant psychological and technical support.\nNow, with the excessive leverage cleared, the market has reset. We are seeing the price reclaim key technical levels, like the 50-week moving average, a classic sign of a trend re-establishing itself. The macro-environment, with ongoing government stimulus talks and inflationary pressures, continues to build the case for a scarce, hard asset.\nThe \"Fk up\" provided a steep discount, shaking out the \"paper hands\" and leaving a stronger foundation. Buying after a massive panic, when others are fearful, is the classic high-conviction move. The weak hands have folded; the smart money is accumulating. This is the dip.",

            "selftext": "Fintech bank SoFi ([SOFI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/)) rolled out crypto trading to retail customers on Tuesday. The move sets the pace as the first of several national banks planning similar moves in the coming months.\n\nSoFi previously gave customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto through its app, but it agreed to shutter that service two years ago to obtain\u00a0[approval](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-4.html#:~:text=The%20conditions%20imposed%20on%20the%20bank%20include:,*%20Provide%20fair%20treatment%20to%20its%20customers)\u00a0for its national banking license.\n\nStarting Tuesday, select retail customers can again trade bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/)), ether ([ETH-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/)), and other crypto assets. The plan is for all of SoFi's 12.6 million customers to gain access before the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cToday marks a pivotal moment when banking meets crypto in one app,\" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a press release statement. \"It\u2019s critical to give our members a secure and regulated way to step into the future of money,\" Noto added.\n\nBiden-era regulators largely discouraged banks from delving into crypto, but US bank regulators [have swiftly reversed that stance during President Trump's first year in office](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sofi-rolls-out-crypto-trading-for-retail-customers-130019758.html).",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s bitcoin and anything can happen, so I\u2019m open to Bitcoin falling to any price. However, I have two points:\n\n1. Everyone is waiting for $45k to $70k bottom to buy more at the next bear market bottom. In fact if Bitcoin didn\u2019t get ETF\u2019s and governments buying, and the genius act to support crypto in general. The bottom is usually near the last top, so around $70k.  But that will get front run by big players and retail. So $70k or anything in the 70\u2019s won\u2019t get hear, and the ETF and government adoption might certainly not let it get there. Plus all of the holding treasury companies I forgot to mention.\n\n2. This amount of selling and floor holding at $100K is creating a floor. We may see this as the bottom of the next cycle (or more than likely the $90k\u2019s for a brief time like a day or so)\n\nMy gut feeling says this is coming. I think if it steadily climbs like it\u2019s been doing, then by February to June (somewhere in there) fomo will set in, not to the new crowd that used to get pulled in. But this will be crypto bros that are used to timing the market. They will have sold in the 100k-$135k range and by $150k there will be none left. They will start fomo-ing in around $160k to $180k which will create the blow off top. ",

We need to show love to the merchants willing to accept Bitcoin.\n\nI'm not asking you to go out of your way to spend money you wouldn't spend otherwise to prove a point. Instead, I'm asking that you:\n\n1. Keep some sats in a lightning wallet, even something simple like Cash app.\n\n2. Keep an eye out for Square merchants that accept Bitcoin. I believe Square will be making a map available soon.\n\n3. Maybe buy your next coffee or your next meal with some sats when you have the chance.\n\n4. Convert more fiat to Sats when you make a purchase.\n\nFour easy steps to accelerate hyperbitcoinization. It's that simple, now put your money where your mouth is and MAKE IT HAPPEN!\n\nInb4 muh Gresham's Law: Shut up and stop being a nerd. There is zero drawback to spending Bitcoin if you immediately convert the fiat.\n",

Ali Abood from Pineapple back again.\n\nLast time we stopped by we introduced Pineapple Express: our community-driven incubator built to identify, back, and launch the most promising projects in crypto and beyond.\n\nToday we\u2019re excited to share the first one launching within the Pineapple umbrella: a Harvard-backed human-performance protocol building tech that connects real human performance with Web3. Their infrastructure is built to power decentralized health and DeSci applications that use verified real-world human data for research, innovation, and new on-chain experiences.\n\nJoining me is Florin Otto (u/motiondevv), CEO of MotionDEV and former co-founder of Human.ai (ATH FDV $1.7B), who\u2019s now leading the charge on bringing DeSci into mainstream consumer tech through Pineapple.\n\nHappy to go deep on:\n\n\u2022 How Pineapple Express identifies, backs, and launches ecosystem projects\n\n\u2022 How motion and performance data are verified on-chain\n\n\u2022 Use cases for athletes, developers, and health researchers\n\n\u2022 Token design, ecosystem incentives, and long-term sustainability\n\n\u2022 How MotionDEV slots into the Pineapple ecosystem and where it scales next\n\n\u2022 Infrastructure, data models, hardware, adoption - and the roadmap from her\n\n\u2022 How developers and researchers can build on top of verified motion data\nHow you can burn PAPPLE to receive MDEV \n\nAsk us anything - we\u2019re looking forward to an open discussion! Whether you\u2019re into sports performance, tech, data ownership, or DeSci, we\u2019d love to hear your perspective.\n\n\u2705 We\u2019ll be heading back here on 12th November at 8pm UTC to answer your questions.\n\n\u2705 We\u2019ll check back in at the same time on 13th November to follow up with any replies.\n\n\u2705 We\u2019ll pick the 5 best answers to win a share of $250 worth of $MDEV tokens.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Over the past months, something special has been happening on the streets of Maputo and Matola. Whenever people see the CHAPA BCH Mozambique car driving by with the Bitcoin Cash emblem, the excitement and curiosity are undeniable\u2014after all, it\u2019s not something you see every day.\n\nBut this excitement goes beyond curiosity. For many passengers, the real highlight is having the possibility to pay for their ride using a decentralized currency. And that, my friends, is the cherry on top.\n\n1. Why passengers enjoy paying with BCH:\n\nPayments confirm instantly\u2014no waiting.\n\nUsers stay in full control of their money without depending on intermediaries.\n\nBCH arrives in seconds, ready to be used immediately.\n\n\nBut there\u2019s something deeper we\u2019re working on: helping Bitcoin Cash evolve from being seen as just \u201ccrypto\u201d to becoming useful, everyday money in Mozambique\u2019s local economy.\n\n2. Education: The real engine behind adoption\n\nThe CHAPA isn\u2019t just a vehicle\u2014it\u2019s becoming a mobile Bitcoin Cash school.\n\nInside the car, passengers find:\n\n- BCH brochures\n\n- YouTube video guides\n\n- Simple explanations from the driver\n\n- And sometimes, free BCH for beginners\n\n\nThis approach has already sparked curiosity among users, and it\u2019s attracting local merchants who see that BCH is being used in real transactions. If one business can accept BCH successfully, others can join voluntarily.\n\n3. A growing movement\n\nCHAPA BCH Mozambique is proving every day that Bitcoin Cash works in the real world. It\u2019s fast, simple, reliable, and practical for daily payments. But the mission doesn\u2019t stop here\u2014we\u2019re also building connections with merchants, hosting monthly meetups, and helping more people learn how to use BCH confidently.\n\n4. We want your ideas\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from the BCH community:\n\nWhat more can we do locally to increase Bitcoin Cash visibility and usability in Mozambique?\nAll ideas are welcome.

I channeled my outrage into projecting the finances of a degen choosing to rent and putting all his money on BTC vs a boomer on a mortgage. Let's call Bob the boomer and Alice the degenerate.\n\nNOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!\n\n**Bob buys a house on a mortgage**\n\n[Bob mortgage payments](https://preview.redd.it/70f7shr2jj0g1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a12cbb34952d6f87b3f6966fe68490fb6a9fb4d5)\n\n**Alice rents**\n\nWe assume a price / rent ratio of 18, which is the average. We assume the rent increases by 3% a year. So day 1, Alice pays 2.4k$ per month and it increases by 3% every year.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nFor a fair comparison, we take Bob  cash-flows, subtract them with those of the degenerate , and assume Alice invests the remainder in an asset that grows with a certain rate of return. I wrote the maths below, it's high school level arithmetics...\n\n[Alice vs Bob net worth calculation](https://preview.redd.it/nhnjgpxsij0g1.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bb845442648cf19a865fb40a4f642d07dc4623)\n\n**Result**\n\nBased on your BTC projection for 2055 - this is what the degenerate Alice gets vs Bob.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jf2okrxeck0g1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=6054a8795445c75645ef07cf2f9d5cd902cc67a3\n\n",

So even if Bitcoin were to \u201conly\u201d hit $1,000,000 by 2035, you would be wayyyy outperforming traditional investments.\n\nIt seems to be using the Stock to Flow model, which I have seen been used before, but it still  seems pretty optimistic. It also seems to be using (what I assume) is a demand model based on cell phone usage??? \n\nDoes anybody have any opinions on this chart? Why would Fidelity make this chart 2 years before the ETFs?",

            "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI\u2019ve been brainstorming alternative ways to generate true entropy for things like BIP39 mnemonic phrases, aside from the typical dice rolls and card shuffling.\n\nMy idea:  \nCreate a simple double or triple pendulum \u2014 3D printed, with each arm fitted with a colored LED for tracking. The idea is that you\u2019d record its motion with a camera (e.g., your phone or a Raspberry Pi), then extract entropy from the \u201cchaotic\u201d movement patterns using open-source code. (Think:\u00a0*LavaLamp RNG but with real-world chaos*\u00a0and visual feedback.)\n\nWhy?\n\n* **Transparency/Trust:**\u00a0The process is visible and auditable.\n* **Physical randomness:**\u00a0Based on \u201creal world\u201d chaotic dynamics, hard to predict or duplicate, and not just pseudo-random numbers.\n* **DIY/remix culture:**\u00a03D print at home or order a pre-made kit; open-source the algorithm for full transparency.\n\nMy questions for you brilliant minds:\n\n1. **How robust would the entropy be?**\u00a0Would this actually be comparable (or at least supplementary) to dice/cards as a randomness source, assuming the camera resolution and tracking are solid?\n2. Any thoughts on possible attack vectors? Could someone \u201crepeat\u201d the sequence if they observed the starting conditions, or is this chaos sufficient?\n3. Would you as self-sovereign wallet users/trust-minimalists see value in such a tool?\n4. Anything I\u2019m overlooking? Pitfalls, caveats?\n\nThanks for your time and effort.",

            "selftext": "A new demo called **compute-escrow-privy** shows what the next stage of Ethereum\u2019s expansion might look like. Built on **EigenCompute**, part of the EigenLayer ecosystem, it connects an ordinary Web2 escrow service to Ethereum\u2019s validator-backed trust model.\n\nIt\u2019s a small project, but it represents something big: the extension of Ethereum\u2019s security into the off-chain world.\n\nThe demo uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) backend and Privy authentication, letting users sign in through standard Web2 methods while the core logic settles verifiably on Ethereum. Developers can fork the repository, deploy it through the EigenX CLI, and run a service that looks like a normal web app but operates under the same type of trust guarantees that secure the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat this shows is more than a technical trick. It is a working demonstration of a new design pattern for how trust itself can be built, reused, and extended.\n\n# 1. Practical verifiability for Web2\n\nInstead of launching new blockchains or validator networks, developers can now anchor traditional applications to Ethereum\u2019s existing security. That makes it practical to build verifiable services \u2014 like escrows, marketplaces, or data processors \u2014 without needing to reinvent the infrastructure of decentralization from scratch.\n\n# 2. ETH as a universal bond\n\nIn this model, **ETH becomes the reusable foundation of digital trust**. The same capital that secures Ethereum\u2019s consensus can now back independent services, functioning as a kind of economic bond for integrity. Each new application strengthens the network\u2019s relevance, because its trust ultimately flows from Ethereum\u2019s validators and the collateral they restake.\n\n# 3. Familiar experience, verifiable core\n\nFrom the user\u2019s perspective, nothing changes \u2014 logins, dashboards, and APIs all feel like the Web2 internet. But under the hood, execution happens in verifiable environments, and outcomes can be proven on-chain. This merges convenience with verifiability instead of forcing a choice between them.\n\n# 4. Broader implications\n\nIf this pattern spreads, it could reshape how the internet handles trust.  \nDevelopers might stop creating new chains for every new idea and instead **reuse Ethereum\u2019s validator base** to secure services directly. A whole market could form around *renting* Ethereum\u2019s trust, where validators, restakers, and developers price and trade cryptographic assurance itself.\n\nIt also means that the boundary between Web2 and Web3 could fade. The same Ethereum security that once applied only to smart contracts could start underpinning AI models, databases, and cloud apps, without users even realizing it.\n\n# 5. A shift in Ethereum\u2019s role\n\nRollups and data blobs scaled Ethereum\u2019s capacity to process transactions. EigenLayer and applications like compute-escrow-privy scale something different: **its trust model**. Ethereum\u2019s reach is no longer confined to blockchains \u2014 it\u2019s becoming a **base layer for verifiable computation**.\n\nWhether this model becomes a standard is uncertain, but its direction is clear. Ethereum\u2019s trust is beginning to extend beyond its own chain, out into the rest of the internet.\n\n**Source:** [Layr-Labs/compute-escrow-privy on GitHub](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/compute-escrow-privy)",

            "selftext": "Launched in October 2025 on Base, Proof of Time (PoT) is an ERC-20 token that introduces a time-based reward system designed to measure holding duration as a form of on-chain value. The project operates through a fixed-supply smart contract with pre-minted reserves, meaning no additional tokens can ever be created after deployment.\n\nPoT\u2019s reward logic is entirely automated and recorded on-chain. Holders who keep tokens in their wallets accrue eligibility over full weeks, beginning after an initial warm-up period. Rewards are distributed proportionally based on holding time and balance, with multipliers increasing over extended streaks. Any outgoing transfer resets the timer, ensuring that long-term participation is consistently recognized.\n\nThe reward pool, accounting for 50% of the total supply, is finite and stored in the main contract. The remaining supply was allocated across the presale, liquidity, treasury, and a time-locked team allocation. All liquidity and team locks are verifiable on BaseScan.\n\nPoT is currently available for trading through Base-compatible aggregators and Aerodrome, with live tracking on GeckoTerminal and pending listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.\n\nContract: 0xe4D22a9af4E14fDF70795dd9c9531295095f0Cb6\nNetwork: Base (Chain ID 8453)\nSupply: 1,000,000,000 PoT\nDecimals: 18\n\n\u2e3b\n\nTL;DR:\nProof of Time (PoT) is a fixed-supply ERC-20 on Base that rewards holders for patience, not activity. Rewards are distributed on-chain from a finite reserve, making time itself a measurable asset in DeFi.\n",

The person that I\u2019m talking to ends up telling me that the person that I\u2019m using to help me get money back or nail the scammer or whatever the case is ends up telling me oh no that person is definitely scamming you, but they never say why, but they can always tell me That I\u2019m in trouble with the person or people that I\u2019m working with.\n\nTurns out a lot of them are correct because I have now been scammed a couple of times for 10 grand apiece by people that are calling themselves rehab hackers   Saying that they\u2019ve gone over to the right side of life because they didn\u2019t want to be associated with the bad hackers so there are good hackers and bad? \n\nSo the professional agencies are telling me there\u2019s nothing they can do because cryptocurrency, theft or scamming is impossible to prove, and even if I can prove every single deposit that I made by following Blockchain, they are telling me that that doesn\u2019t prove anything even though it goes to the same company And hacker people. Tell me they can trace it quite easily to a couple of main wallets that it\u2019s being dumped into so how come the hackers can find this information out but the professional agencies that are supposed to be helping us can\u2019t.?\n\nAm I expected to believe that hackers are more computer savvy than anybody in the white-collar industries? \n\nIs that possible that we don\u2019t have any smart people working for the good guy?",

            "selftext": "Yo r/bitcoin fam,I'm just a regular dude who's been diving headfirst into coding 'cause I'm obsessed with Bitcoin and wanna build stuff that makes this wild ride a bit more fun and helpful for all of us. No fancy dev background here\u2014I've been working away for about a month now, fueled by coffee and late-night Satoshi memes. Got three little web prototypes cooking that I think could add some value (or at least some laughs) to the community. But I'm stuck: which one should I double down on? I've tested 'em out myself, but y'all are the real experts\u2014holders, miners, noobs, and OGs alike. Hit me with your thoughts, roast 'em if they suck, or suggest epic upgrades. Let's make Bitcoin even more awesome together!Quick intros to each (links included if you wanna poke around\u2014 they're super basic right now, built with some simple tools, but hey, gotta start somewhere):\n\n1. [Satoshi Ball](http://satoshiball-blttcixx.manus.space)\n   * Basically a magic 8-ball but powered by the spirit of Satoshi. Ask it Bitcoin questions like \"Should I buy the dip?\" or \"Is this altcoin a scam?\" and it spits out cryptic, fun answers. Think oracle for your HODL decisions!\n   * Why I'm hyped: It's lighthearted, could help newbies get a chuckle while learning, and who doesn't love a bit of mysticism in crypto?\n   * Status: Prototype's live, but needs more polish and maybe AI smarts.\n2. [Crypto Weather](http://cryptoweath-76bf8scd.manus.space)\n   * A \"weather forecast\" for the Bitcoin market\u2014sunny skies for bull runs, thunderstorms for dumps, with quick stats on price, sentiment, and news. Like checking the weather app before heading out, but for your portfolio.\n   * Why I'm hyped: Makes market volatility feel less scary and more predictable, especially for folks who check charts obsessively (guilty as charged).\n   * Status: Half-baked, got the basics working but wanna add real-time data feeds.\n3. [Panic Button](http://cryptobtn-kkgkropo.manus.space)\n   * Ever freak out during a flash crash? This is a big red button you \"press\" to get instant calming tips, meme distractions, or even quick sell alerts (but mostly to remind you to breathe and HODL). No actual trading, just anti-panic vibes.\n   * Why I'm hyped: We've all been there\u2014paper hands moments suck. This could save some sanity in the community.\n   * Status: Early days, functional but could use community-suggested features like custom alerts.\n\nSo, what do ya think? Satoshi Ball for the fun factor? Crypto Weather for practical daily use? Panic Button to keep us all from rage-quitting? Or scrap 'em all and pivot to something else? I'm all ears\u2014pros, cons, \"this reminds me of X app,\" tech tips (I'm using basic web stuff, open to suggestions), or even if you'd actually use one. Bonus points if you've got Bitcoin-specific twists to add!Thanks a bunch for reading my ramble and dropping wisdom. This sub's always inspired me\u2014let's keep the orange pill rolling!What's your vote? Spill below!",

            "selftext": "Someone tell me if AI got this explanation correct below:\n\nHow Jasmy and Janction (JCT) Work Together, Like a Story for a 5-Year-Old\nImagine you have a super-secret toy box called Jasmy. It's like a magic safe where you hide your favorite drawings, photos, or stories about your day (that's your \"data\" from toys like phones or cars). Only you decide who gets to peek inside, and if you share, you can even get stickers (rewards) for being brave. Everyone loves playing in the big playground built around this safe box because it's fair and no one steals your stuff.\n\nNow, picture Janction (JCT) as a cool robot-building workshop right next to the playground. It's a special room full of fast computers (called GPUs, like super brains) where kids team up to make smart robots that draw pictures, tell jokes, or help with homework (that's \"AI\" magic). But to build the best robots, the workshop needs trusted toys from the safe box\u2014without them, the robots might use fake or yucky stories.\n\nHow they team up like best friends: The workshop (Janction) asks the safe box (Jasmy) for safe, real toys to make its robots smarter and more fun. In return, the workshop says \"thank you\" by giving extra stickers from the Jasmy box to kids who help run the computers or play in the workshop (that's JCT holders getting free Jasmy stickers as surprises, called airdrops). The workshop buys these stickers from the toy store (open market) so everyone wins\u2014no taking from the box directly. This makes the Jasmy stickers super popular because more kids want them to join the fun, and the workshop gets a strong, safe playground to build on.\n\nHow they help each other grow: Jasmy's safe box gets way more kids visiting the whole playground because the robot workshop is so exciting\u2014it pulls in new friends who bring their own toys. Janction's workshop shines brighter with Jasmy's trust magic, so more kids trust it to rent computer time or vote on new robot ideas. Together, they make a bigger, happier playground where sharing feels safe and rewarding.\n\nTheir Roles in Different Use Cases (Real-World Jobs)\nJasmy's Role (The Safe Box Keeper): It's the boss of keeping your personal stuff private and useful. Think everyday fun like:\nYour smartwatch or car sharing your steps or drives safely, so companies pay you tiny bits of money (rewards) without spying.\nApps where you control your photos or videos, earning stickers for letting AI use them to make cool filters or stories.\nBig companies (like Panasonic) using it to store \"verified data\" so everything's honest\u2014no fakes.\n\nJanction's Role (The Robot Workshop Builder): It's all about sharing computer power for brainy tasks. Perfect for:\nRenting out your home computer (GPU) to help train smart chatbots or draw art, earning money like $2,400 a month for top helpers.\nTeams voting (governance) on how to make the workshop better, like adding more computers or fair rules.\nAI jobs like video editing or science experiments that need fast brains, paid with JCT coins or credits.\n\nJasmy handles the \"safe sharing\" part (data privacy in IoT gadgets), while Janction adds the \"smart building\" part (AI computing on top). They fit together: Jasmy's safe data feeds Janction's robots, and Janction's growth buys more Jasmy to keep the circle going.\n\n\nI think this explaination can quell confusion amongst Jasmy holders. Janction a layer 2 is built upon the JASMY ecosystem not vice versa.   Remember Jasmy PDLs store data from Janction and Janction also accesses  the PDLs on behalf of users ( mostly small to medium enterprises ) for various purposes related to Ai ,compute etc. \n\nFeel free to share your opinion.

            "selftext": "So about 6 months ago, I had a small pile of random gift cards \u2014 Walmart, a prepaid Visa, even one from some store I never even heard of before. None of the usual resell sites were giving decent rates, and I\u2019d seen people mention this thing called NoOnes in a few crypto forums. Figured what the hell, I\u2019ll try it.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I was nervous about it. Peer-to-peer trading sounds sketchy if you\u2019ve ever been burned online. But NoOnes has an escrow system built in \u2014 basically, your crypto or payment stays locked until both sides confirm the trade. That made it feel a little safer, so I started small.\n\nFirst trade I ever did was selling a $150 Walmart gift card for $90 worth of BTC. Took 23 minutes in total. The buyer released the payment right after I sent the code, and it showed up in my wallet almost instantly. After that, I got hooked. I started using it to buy and sell small bits of crypto whenever the rates made sense \u2014 it\u2019s kind of addicting once you get the hang of it.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned so far:\n\nStick to verified users with a solid trade history and high feedback.\n\nNever take a deal off the platform \u2014 if someone says \u201cmessage me on Telegram,\u201d just don\u2019t.\n\nDon\u2019t rush; it\u2019s better to lose five minutes checking profiles than lose money.\n\n\nThere are definitely a few sketchy users floating around, but that\u2019s true on every P2P site. The key is just knowing how to read people\u2019s trade pages and feedback before diving in.\n\nOne thing I didn\u2019t expect is how many payment options there are. I\u2019ve seen everything from PayPal and bank transfers to mobile money and store-specific gift cards. It\u2019s honestly kind of crazy \u2014 you can find a way to trade almost anything for crypto if you\u2019re patient.\n\nI\u2019ve had a couple of slower trades, and support once took a bit to reply, but I\u2019ve never been scammed or lost money. It\u2019s not a get-rich thing, it\u2019s just a useful tool \u2014 especially if you\u2019ve got leftover cards collecting dust or you want to move small amounts of crypto without the usual exchange hassle.

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve seen dozens of crypto projects fail. I\u2019ve seen a handful of crypto companies succeed.\n\nTo succeed, many hard things must align. To fail, only one key thing needs to go wrong.\n\nAfter nearly a decade in this space, one pattern repeats itself:\u00a0**the fastest path to failure is biasing toward idealism over pragmatism.**\n\nI joined the industry for its ideals. It took years - and a few hard lessons - to unlearn them.\n\n# Not About Memes or Casinos\n\nThis post is about projects trying to\u00a0*create*\u00a0value, not extract it. Those building new rails, not just running the same casino onchain.\n\nMemes and casinos have their own kind of Product-Market-Fit. They entertain, they speculate, they move money. But they don\u2019t\u00a0*build*. They redistribute value rather than generate it.\n\n**In short, this post is about teams growing the pie, not just grabbing the bigger slice.**\n\n*Now that the disclaimer\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s get into it.*\n\n# Changing My Mind\n\nI first dipped my toes into crypto in 2016, back when Vitalik would reply to my tweets or answer my technical questions on Gitter. For the past four years, I\u2019ve been all in, building full-time.\n\nThat transition, from observer to participant, is when you start facing real tradeoffs. It\u2019s when you stop quoting whitepapers and start debugging production systems. And it\u2019s when your ideals begin to meet reality.\n\nBelow are examples I often bring up when discussing how\u00a0**pragmatism (not purity) led to success.**\u00a0These are companies I\u2019ve been learning from.\n\n# Pragmatic Successes\n\n[**PolyMarket**](https://www.polymarket.com/)\u00a0proved that stablecoins beat custom tokens for early traction in prediction markets. Back in 2016,\u00a0[Augur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_(software))\u00a0and\u00a0[Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/ten-years-of-gnosis-from-prediction-markets-to-a-user-owned-open-finance-revolution)\u00a0kicked off the decentralized prediction markets ecosystem. Most people today haven\u2019t heard of Augur, and know Gnosis mainly as a multisig or credit card company. But, everyone\u2019s heard of PolyMarket, especially after their\u00a0[$2B raise at a $9B valuation](https://insights4vc.substack.com/p/polymarket-raises-2b-at-9b-valuation). Their key move was focusing on product over tokenomics, avoiding getting\u00a0[nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/)\u00a0by shiny ideals.\n\n[**Solana**](https://www.solana.com/)\u00a0showed that choosing speed over decentralization can capture real users. Solana\u2019s vision was to run at the speed of the Nasdaq onchain. One of crypto\u2019s deepest ideals is that anyone should be able to run a node or validator at home, in their basement, on a laptop, as part of the network\u2019s collective strength. In practice, running a Solana validator requires professional-grade hardware and DevOps skills. It\u2019s like needing to be an F1 driver just to commute to work. Solana made the hard tradeoff of centralization for performance, and it paid off. With a \\~$91B market cap, pragmatism clearly won.\n\n**Stablecoins**\u00a0became crypto\u2019s paradoxical success by embracing regulation and existing rails. Bitcoin dreamed of divorcing from the existing financial system; stablecoins married it. Now they\u2019re on track for\u00a0[$46T in annual volume](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/), with\u00a0[Circle](https://www.circle.com/)\u00a0IPOing and the\u00a0[GENIUS Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text)\u00a0adding clarity. They\u2019re as anti-crypto-ideal as it gets, and yet, not showing any signs of slowing down.\n\n[**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com/)\u00a0thrived by offering custody and compliance instead of maximalist purity. Crypto said:\u00a0*Not your keys, not your coins.*\u00a0Coinbase said:\u00a0*Most people don\u2019t want to manage keys.*\u00a0They made the pragmatic choice to build for real users, not ideals, and onboarded millions because of it.\n\n[**Privy**](https://www.privy.io/)\u00a0is arguably one of the most successful wallets in crypto. Its mission is to bring people onchain, and I\u2019ve heard dozens of founders say it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened to the industry in years. Yet it doesn\u2019t have a token, it isn\u2019t\u00a0*\u201ccrypto-native,\u201d*\u00a0and it relies heavily on AWS to store user keys \\[1\\]. Its CEO and co-founder,\u00a0[Henri Stern](https://sequoiacap.com/founder/henri-stern/), spent four years as a protocol research engineer at FileCoin, a project that embodied true crypto ideals. That experience likely gave him a clear sense of when decentralization helps and when it only slows you down. Privy succeeded by focusing on the user experience over crypto ideals.\n\n**In crypto, pragmatism isn\u2019t about compromise, it\u2019s about sequencing. You can decentralize later. You can tokenize later. But you have to survive in the beginning.**\n\n# It\u2019s Never That Simple\n\nFailure can hinge on one thing. Success demands a harmonic symphony: UI, UX, timing, execution, luck. All must play in tune.\n\nMost people in the OG crypto space start with ideals. That\u2019s good as it draws in smart, mission-driven people. But idealism alone doesn\u2019t build resilient systems.\n\n**Pragmatism doesn\u2019t guarantee success. Idealism often guarantees failure.**\n\nThe only true exceptions? Bitcoin and Ethereum. \\[2\\]\n\n# A Thought to End On\n\n**Decentralization is a byproduct of a permissionless and incentivized system.**\u00a0It\u2019s an end to a means, not a means to an end.\n\nA fully privacy-preserving, decentralized, permissionless world sounds perfect in theory. In practice, it stalls progress, innovation, and usability.\n\nIn crypto, as in life,\u00a0**survival belongs to the pragmatists.**\n\n# tl;dr How to Bias Toward Pragmatism over Idealism\n\n1. **Don\u2019t tokenize too early.**\u00a0Start with stablecoins or fiat rails.\n2. **Don\u2019t decentralize too early.**\u00a0Use centralized infra, design for later decentralization.\n3. **Find Product-Market Fit first.**\u00a0Once you have PMF, you can afford ideals and earn the right to strive towards them.\n\n\\---\n\n\\[1\\] Ironically, the world\u2019s most private messenger (Signal)\u00a0[runs mostly on AWS](https://www.theverge.com/news/807147/signal-aws-outage-meredith-whittaker). It works because users value reliability over purity.\n\n\\[2\\] I\u2019d argue that Zcash is a third exception, but one that\u2019s not known as well (yet). I remember listening to the podcast episode on\u00a0[The Ceremony: Birth of Zcash](https://ma.ttias.be/podcast-ceremony-birth-zcash/)\u00a0back in 2017 and being blown away by the amount of work that went into it.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve posted about Katana quite a bit before, and I\u2019m deeply involved in the ecosystem. The main reason is the yield structure. Stablecoin vaults consistently return around 5\u20137% in-kind, and on top of that, Katana distributes KAT rewards. Even though KAT isn\u2019t tradable yet, if it launches with around a $1 billion FDV, my current yield would be about 40% APR. Even if it opens lower, the combination of base yield and rewards still makes it the strongest setup I\u2019ve found across DeFi.\n\nWhat stands out most to me is how Katana approaches vault curation and risk management. The team doesn\u2019t surface every vault available. They focus on a curated set that meets their transparency and risk standards. Vaults surfaced in the Katana app and curated through Vaultbridge were completely untouched by the xUSD and Balancer events that affected other platforms. That outcome reflects how Katana designs its system rather than reacting after the fact.\n\nVaultbridge works with partners like Steakhouse, Gauntlet, and Yearn to create transparent, onchain, risk-adjusted strategies built on blue-chip collateral with conservative LTVs. Katana then channels yield from these vaults back into the network through foundation-managed liquidity and reward programs. The result is consistent, visible, and repeatable yield onchain.\n\nKatana\u2019s structure attracts institutional partners who care about both performance and capital protection. The design of the protocol puts fund safety, transparency, and sustainable yield at the core of the chain itself.\n\nI\u2019ve tried a lot of platforms, and Katana is the one that\u2019s managed to align strong yield, conservative risk management, and transparent onchain strategy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m comfortable keeping my funds there.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2txepqzvyh0g1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7dc93e51a29455b384724299b4646ab409e051c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18ba6taxyh0g1.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d37e101ebf1217446fb0d4d48d7aeef79c47f78\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo0hgvvxyh0g1.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ade14250a9509324971cca9a40ea07da2a364c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbaye7iyyh0g1.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c788bc40680a80a131f16af15430ab416f17ab9\n\nLink to tweet that inspired this post: [https://x.com/katana/status/1987956452837703874?s=20](https://x.com/katana/status/1987956452837703874?s=20)",

            "selftext": "In 2014, I experimented with bitcoin mining for a short time as a \"let's see what this is about\" exercise and pretty much forgot about it. Seeing what bitcoin is worth rn, I thought it prudent to see what I had mined is worth. I don't really recall what I had, but I think around 1/3 of a bitcoin. Anyway, I found the old hard drive from the machine I had been using to mine, and found the armory wallet root key (18 four-character 'words'). My question is whether it's possible and how to best go from that key to accessing the actual wallet. I installed the old armory software and it seemed to accept the root key and give the correct wallet id, but it said it needed to be connected bitcoin software before it could proceed. Before I go and make a mess of things, I thought it would be a good idea to ask the experts and get some guidance on next steps. Any advice is appreciated.",

I\u2019m in the USA.  I purchased some bitcoin some time ago at Coinbase.  It has definitely increased in value since I purchased it.  I know I need to get it off the exchange, and I do have a hardware wallet.  If I transfer my BTC to my wallet does that trigger a taxable event in CB?\nThrowaway for obvious reasons, and any and all DMs will be deleted without being read. \nThanks!",

With the capital he has, he could create a massive revenue stream of Bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019m wondering myself, with a considerable amount of capital in hand, if mining is worth doing. I\u2019m an EU resident, and due to electricity costs mining is impossible, but I have already used cloud miners.\n\nBasically, do you think MicroStrategy is missing out by not mining, or is focusing entirely on buying the smarter move? Sorry if this has been posted before. I'm new here.",

            "title": "Why Web3 Domains Are Better Usernames",
            "selftext": "Traditional usernames were created to serve platforms, not people.\n\nEvery app has its own system. You create a Twitter handle. A Discord tag. A Reddit name. A login for every exchange, wallet, and dApp. None of them talk to each other, and none of them belong to you.\n\nThis fragmentation goes beyond inconvenience. It reflects a deeper problem: in the traditional web, your identity is something you rent, not something you own.\n\nWeb3 domains change that.\n\n# The Problem With Usernames\n\nUsernames are siloed by design. They\u2019re tied to the platform where they were created, and they can be taken away, suspended, or reassigned at any time.\n\nYou can\u2019t transfer your identity. You can\u2019t verify it across apps. You can\u2019t take it with you. And if someone else grabs the name you want, it\u2019s gone \u2014 possibly forever.\n\nMore importantly, a username is not a credential. It exists only as long as the platform allows it.\n\n# What Makes Web3 Domains Different\n\nWeb3 domains are stored in your wallet and secured by the blockchain. No one can reassign them, edit them, or suspend them. Once minted, they\u2019re yours.\n\nThat ownership unlocks functionality usernames simply can\u2019t match. You can use the same domain to:\n\n* Log in to dApps\n* Receive crypto payments\n* Build a unified profile\n* Send and receive onchain messages\n* Access gated communities or experiences\n\nYou don\u2019t need to re-register. You don\u2019t need to manage multiple identities. You don\u2019t need to trust a platform to respect your name. The system is built to work for you.\n\n# Built for Portability\n\nWeb3 domains are designed to move with you.\n\nInstead of creating a new username every time you join a new app, your domain follows you. You can connect it to social platforms, DeFi protocols, wallets, games, marketplaces, and more.\n\nAs adoption grows, your name becomes your default identity across the Web3 ecosystem. One name. One login. One profile. Persistent and portable.\n\n# One Identity, Not a Dozen Accounts\n\nTraditional usernames force you to build a reputation in isolated bubbles. You might have one users on Reddit and another on X. None of those profiles are connected. None of them tell a complete story.\n\nWith a Web3 domain, you maintain a consistent identity across apps. You don\u2019t have to rebuild from scratch every time you try something new. Your domain becomes your access point, your public name, and your reputation anchor \u2014 all in one.\n\nThat continuity is valuable whether you\u2019re a creator, a collector, a builder, or someone just getting started.\n\n# What About DNS Domains?\n\nNot all domains are equal. Some DNS domains can be placed onchain, allowing them to participate in the Web3 ecosystem. But DNS domains are still subject to renewals, registrar rules, and external control.\n\nWeb3 domains are fully minted onchain and owned outright. No renewals. No middlemen. No reliance on centralized infrastructure.\n\nIf the goal is ownership, this distinction matters.\n\n# Owning Your Name Means Owning Your Identity\n\nA username identifies you only within the boundaries of the platform that issued it.\n\nA Web3 domain gives you ownership of your name across platforms, protocols, and use cases. You can log in, transact, build, and communicate without needing to rebuild your identity every time.\n\nThe internet is shifting from accounts to identity. And identity starts with a name you actually control.",

            "selftext": "I've been a big Pok\u00e9mon fan since my childhood, and I've always been curious about why no one has yet perfected a proper marketplace for this.\n\nNaturally, I was looking for alternatives, but always felt strange about specific aspects. Either thinking the backing of the physical card was not there, or key metrics were missing.\n\nBut then a few days ago, I stumbled across the Pok\u00e9mon NFT marketplace by Magic Eden, and to my surprise, saw that they were collaborating with Collector Crypt.\n\nOne of the best places to rank and authenticate cards. Also they have a cool feature where you can decide to keep and trade the card, throw the pack back in the mix or even request to redeem the card IRL.\n\nHas anyone here already looked at this? Curious to see what you guys think.",

I haven't found the option to do so on the Kraken Pro app. I did find it on normal Kraken app, but it charges a fee of around 1% per purchase, which I believe is too high.\n\nIs there any way to setup a recurring purchase without fees or with lower ones? Is this possible with Kraken or I should use another exchange / app?\n\nNote: It's a business account (created for a LLC), not a personal one.\n\nThanks in advance.",

MON is the Monad network\u2019s native token, used to pay gas fees, secure the chain via staking, and align validators, developers, and users around the growth of the protocol.*\n\n*Coinbase token sales has provided a platform for the Monad Foundation to distribute MON through a public sale via its subsidiary, MF Services (BVI), Ltd., enabling the purchase of MON tokens right before the launch of Monad Public Mainnet on November 24th, 2025. It will open on Monday, November 17th, 2025 at 9:00 AM ET and run until Saturday, November 22nd, 2025 at 9:00 PM ET. Those interested in learning more or participating in the public sale can do so* [*here*](https://www.coinbase.com/token-sales/monad)*.*\n\n*Monad\u2019s mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain, through state of the art financial infrastructure. Monad will execute on this vision through three overarching pillars:*\n\n*1. Enabling the Best Experience for Developers*\n\n*2. Global Reach and Impact*\n\n*3. Best-in-Class Technology*\n\n**Monad\u2019s Mission**\n\nOn November 24th, the world will witness the culmination of several years of technological innovation and engineering when the Monad Public Mainnet launches along with its native network token, MON. Monad is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain engineered for speed without sacrificing security or decentralization, all while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Monad team has always been focused on building tomorrow\u2019s tech, today. The mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain, through state of the art financial infrastructure.\n\nSuccess requires disruption. The north star is to see the entire global population utilizing applications built on top of Monad. These applications are uniquely enabled and powered by Monad and have the potential to improve lives. An exceptionally performant blockchain that is also decentralized can unlock new app experiences and use cases while also substantially improving the experience of existing ones. However, increased performance without compromising decentralization is the ultimate unlock. It allows for a censorship-resistant blockchain that can withstand the test of time. Operating through intense geopolitical turmoil, banking the unbanked, and serving the needs of global citizens are ideals that have true staying power in an ever-evolving world.\n\nMonad will execute on this vision through three overarching pillars:\n\n1. Enabling the Best Experience for Developers\n2. Global Reach and Impact\n3. Best-in-Class Technology\n\n**Enabling the Best Experience for Developers**\n\nMonad\u2019s success depends on a thriving ecosystem of applications and developers. This is only possible when Monad is the premier place to build and deploy applications. EVM compatibility already reduces the bulk of friction for developers, but initiatives like [Monad Madness](https://madness.monad.xyz/) and the [Monad Founder Residency](https://residency.monad.xyz/) connected founders with world-class investors to gain invaluable exposure and funding to jumpstart their businesses. Accelerators like [Mach](https://mach.monad.xyz/) expedited the speed at which developers and project teams were able to ship initial proof of concepts and hit the ground running.\n\nPhysical spaces like [The Studio](https://x.com/thestudio_xyz) and The Founder Lounge have allowed builders to engage in thoughtful discussions around building startups and exchange valuable knowledge with industry veterans. Meetups organized by Monad community members have created a network of globally distributed advocates for the protocol.\n\nAll of these exemplify why the Monad ecosystem is conducive to innovative applications and killer businesses that will drive forward the evolution of Monad\u2019s onchain economy. One that is permissionless and accessible to developers around the world.\n\n**Global Reach and Impact**\n\nWhile there have been substantial technological improvements across the crypto industry in the past decade, there is still a significant gap to bridge between market needs and the complexity of blockchain technology. The addressable market in crypto will become much larger by meeting users where they are.\n\nThis requires global expansion and stronger distribution that is both relevant and accessible. As the number of use cases continues to grow, new audiences and end users are emerging for crypto applications. Financial institutions are increasingly leveraging blockchain technology because of its greater effectiveness compared to legacy systems. Latin America is experiencing an explosion in payments adoption as users migrate online and move towards stablecoins. Southeast Asia is seeing strong growth in enterprise opportunities for blockchains with increasing demand for digital currencies.\n\nWe hope to see the Monad ecosystem embed itself across these geographies and userbases to generate the largest impact possible, empowering both developers and users alike.\u00a0\n\n**Best-in-Class Technology**\n\nThe design of the Monad blockchain centers around the most important vectors for application development:\n\n1. **EVM Compatibility:** Monad is designed to reduce developer friction. Monad\u2019s re-architecture of the EVM perfected the work of predecessors at Ethereum while maintaining easy access to a vast developer ecosystem and tooling. Instead of forcing developers to learn a new programming language, Monad is molded around their needs.\n2. **Performance:** Technical innovations like a custom database ([MonadDB](https://monad-docs.vercel.app/monad-arch/execution/monaddb)) and execution optimizations ([Optimistic Parallel Execution](https://blog.monad.xyz/blog/how-monad-works#optimistic-parallel-execution)) have allowed Monad to achieve the speed necessary for mainstream applications. The Monad architecture was designed from the ground up to enable use cases like High-frequency trading (HFT) and consumer applications that were not feasible before due to performance limitations.\u00a0\n3. **Decentralization:** Performance alone without decentralization opens up a blockchain to censorship concerns. Monad\u2019s new software algorithms and a globally distributed network of validators make the blockchain resistant to censorship while providing durable access to a range of necessary services for users around the world.\n\nThe challenge for any blockchain has been the blockchain trilemma: how to optimize for security, scalability, and decentralization while balancing heavy tradeoffs. Instead, Monad solved the blockchain trilemma by pushing the boundaries of what is possible with innovative technology. Our hope is that Monad will only continue to grow more performant and decentralized over time. And now it is time to open Monad up to the world.\n\n**Public sale on Coinbase token sales platform**\n\nDecentralization is only possible with widely distributed ownership of the MON token. A healthy ecosystem consists not only of developers and users, but also tokenholders. We are pleased to share that Coinbase has provided a platform for the Monad Foundation to distribute MON through a [public sale](http://coinbase.com/blog/the-ideal-way-to-launch-introducing-token-sales-on-coinbase) by its subsidiary, MF Services (BVI), Ltd.\u00a0\n\nThe Coinbase token sales platform brings public sales to retail purchasers in the US and globally, allowing for smaller allocations across more participants. The public sale will enable the purchase of MON tokens right before the launch of Monad Public Mainnet on November 24th, 2025. It will open on Monday, November 17th, 2025 at 9:00 AM ET and run until Saturday, November 22nd, 2025 at 9:00 PM ET.\n\nMON is the Monad network\u2019s native token, used to pay gas fees, secure the chain via staking, and align validators, developers, and users around the growth of the protocol. At the launch of Monad Public Mainnet, the total initial supply of MON will be 100 billion tokens. Up to 7.5B $MON tokens (7.5% of initial token supply) will be made available to the public for purchase in the public sale at a price of $0.025 per token. The Coinbase token sales platform accommodates a minimum bid size of $100 and a maximum bid size of $100,000 (subject to higher maximum thresholds for Coinbase One subscribers pursuant to the Coinbase token sale platform terms).\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jonv5dl8wf0g1.png?width=2586&format=png&auto=webp&s=8142d647000ef6648b5f00174f515b72cde4aacd\n\nFollowing completion of the public sale, coincident with the launch of Monad Mainnet, MON tokens will be distributed to purchasers. If the public sale is undersubscribed, any unsold tokens will be reallocated to ecosystem development. If the total number of requested tokens is greater than the total available tokens, a distribution mechanism called \u201cfilling up from the bottom,\u201d will create a broad distribution among sale participants and limit asset concentration among large purchasers. Additional details on MON tokenomics are available in the [MON Tokenomics Overview](https://www.monad.xyz/announcements/mon-tokenomics-overview).\n\nWe look forward to the launch of the Monad Public Mainnet and MON. Those interested in learning more or participating in the public sale can do so [here](https://www.coinbase.com/token-sales/monad).\n\nThe Monad Foundation will also be hosting an AMA on r/CryptoCurrency from November 24-26th, 2025. We hope that you will join us as we answer questions that you may have about Monad.",

Instead of paying card fees or exchange withdrawal fees, you just pick the coin you want, choose your wallet (Trust Wallet, etc.), and scan to receive. Super simple.\n\nWhy I like it:\n\n* No intermediary fees from exchanges for small local trades \n* Uses familiar wallets (Trust, MetaMask, etc.) \u2014 you keep control of funds \n* Local, fast and private compared to buying on an exchange or via card\n* Great for meeting other HODLers or swapping into something you need quickly",

I looked it up later out of curiosity  and honestly, it made me rethink the whole idea. It\u2019s not about \u201ccrypto\u201d hype. It\u2019s about independence. About not needing five companies to approve a simple exchange between two adults.\n\nFor the first time, I saw Bitcoin not as speculation, but as utility.\n\nAnd that felt way more meaningful than any\u00a0price\u00a0movement.",

As such, they will incrementally pile in therefore reinforcing the price on the way up despite the diminishing returns factor.\n\nJust a thought.",

The drop has been blamed on heavy liquidations (over $19 billion), a stronger U.S. dollar, low market liquidity, and losses in altcoins. Despite the correction, analysts remain bullish mid-term, suggesting this could be a buying opportunity, with some predicting BTC could reach $170K within 12 months. The warning: short-term pain may continue before any new rally takes shape.",

            "selftext": "# Preamble\n\nWelcome to the CCMOON DAO update marking the start of Moon Week 68. This update highlights significant financial growth, key integrations, new sponsorships, and upcoming governance proposals that will shape the next phase of the DAO\u2019s development.\n\nThe DAO continues to progress toward formal legal registration through MIDAO, expanding partnerships, and strengthening DeFi use cases for Moons. In the weeks since the last update, we have seen strong revenue inflows, expanded liquidity positions, and new integrations that continue to bring real utility and value to the ecosystem.\n\n# 1. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\nCCMOON DAO Constitution v0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution)  \nWebsite: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0)  \nGovernance: [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck)  \nTransparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology & Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 2. Treasury Overview\n\nAs of November 9, 2025, the DAO Treasury holds approximately $12,168 in non-Moon assets and 823,192 Moons.\n\nMoons decreased by 25,000, representing a transfer to the Community Currency App Bot to refill rewards for outstanding distributions. ETH remains unchanged in quantity but decreased in fiat value due to price movement. The DAO\u2019s stablecoin holdings increased significantly as more sponsorship payments were received.\n\nTreasury Holdings:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|823,192|$52,157|\n|ETH|0.83683|$2,998|\n|USDC|6,826|$6,826|\n|USDT|1,301|$1,301|\n|ARB|1,848|$556|\n|USDC.E (bridged)|487|$487|\n\nNon-Moon value: $12,168  \nChange since last update: +$3,417  \nStablecoin value (USDC, USDT, USDC.E): $8,614  \nChange in stablecoins since last update: +$3,489\n\n# 3. Burn Summary\n\nArbitrum One: 1,038,094 Moons burned  \nArbitrum Nova: 3,189,800 Moons burned  \nTotal burned: 4,227,894 Moons\n\nSince the October 30 update:  \n\u2022 Arbitrum Nova increased by 57,546 Moons (largely from Kraken\u2019s burn event)  \n\u2022 Arbitrum One increased by 117 Moons  \n\u2022 Combined total increase: 57,663 Moons burned\n\nThese burns highlight continued advertiser demand and the positive impact of large-scale partner events on Moon supply reduction.\n\n# 4. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)\n\nThe DAO now operates two Uniswap liquidity positions to improve balance and fee efficiency.\n\nFirst position (original pool, 0.05% fee tier):  \n\u2022 Composition: 67,654 Moons and 960 USDC  \n\u2022 Value: $5,455  \n\u2022 Total fees earned since last update: $134.37  \n\u2022 Breakdown: 1,081 Moons and 62.53 USDC collected  \n\u2022 These fees will be redeployed into liquidity after collection\n\nSecond position (new pool, 0.3% fee tier):  \n\u2022 Composition: 2,379 Moons and 126.02 USDC  \n\u2022 Value: $284.08  \n\u2022 Fees earned: $0.74\n\nCombined DAO-owned liquidity value: $5,739.08  \nChange since last update: +$1,948\n\nThese two positions give the DAO flexibility to capture more trading volume during price swings and maintain deeper market presence without needing to sell Moons for rebalancing.\n\n# 5. Distribution Updates\n\nPolygon Labs has contributed $5,000 in POL tokens to the DAO, equivalent to 25,000 POL for distribution to subreddit users.\n\nFor Moon Week 68, the DAO will distribute 6,820 Moons, reflecting cumulative revenue-based allocation since Epochs 67 and 68.\n\nThe Community Currency App is now fully back online. Redundancies have been added to ensure users can always claim their rewards in the event of future outages.\n\nSince the last update on October 29, the DAO received $8,284 in new revenue from Kraken, Monad, [Rails.xyz](http://Rails.xyz), Quickswap, and ETH Strategy. Kraken\u2019s payment was a pure burn, so the DAO will make up the equivalent amount by allocating future revenues to the Distribution, Treasury, and DAO-Owned Liquidity pools before resuming additional burns.\n\n# 6. Governance and Upcoming Proposals\n\nTwo major proposals will go live this Moon Week:\n\n1. Formalizing CCMOON DAO as a legal Marshall Islands non-profit DAO LLC through MIDAO.\n2. Authorizing DAO officers to negotiate advertising partnerships with protocols, projects, or personalities that add utility and visibility to Moons.\n\nThese votes mark key next steps for formal structure and operational autonomy within the DAO.\n\n# 7. Teller Integration and Moon Utility\n\nMoons are officially live on Teller, and users can now use their Moons as collateral to borrow USDC or deposit them to earn yield. Teller held an AMA on the subreddit to guide users through the process.\n\nThis integration provides another major use case for Moons in DeFi. Teller\u2019s initial incentive pool is paying a high APY for Moon deposits, funded directly by their treasury, though rewards will decrease over time as total deposits grow.\n\n# 8. Future Plans\n\nThe DAO\u2019s top priority remains completing legal registration with MIDAO as a Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This will formalize structure, provide legal protection, and enable direct contracting with partners.\n\nOther active initiatives include:  \n\u2022 Continuing DeFi integrations like Teller and Uniswap liquidity expansion  \n\u2022 Pursuing grants to support DEX integrations on [ccmoons.com](http://ccmoons.com)  \n\u2022 Building faster bridge solutions between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One  \n\u2022 Hosting recurring AMAs and live DAO updates across platforms to expand beyond Reddit\n\nThat concludes the CCMOON DAO update for November 9, 2025. The next update will provide results from the Moon Week 68 governance votes, updated revenue totals, and any additional partnership or liquidity developments.",

Market cap has **nothing** to do with how much money \u201cflowed into\u201d an asset. It\u2019s literally just current price \u00d7 total supply. That\u2019s it.\n\nI'll give a very simplified example:\n\nLet\u2019s say there are **100 identical gold coins** in existence.  \nI have one, and I sell it for **$10** (which is the current lowest going price) on a \u201cgold coin exchange.\u201d That\u2019s now the current price, so market cap = 100 coins \u00d7 $10 = *$1,000*\n\nNow imagine everyone suddenly realizes these coins are actually super valuable \u2014 they can\u2019t be inflated, seized, etc. Holders don\u2019t want to sell anymore unless they get way more for them.\n\nThe next person who decides to sell says, *\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll sell mine for $10,000,\u201d* and someone actually buys it.\n\nWhat happens? The market cap instantly becomes 100 coins \u00d7 $10,000 = *$1,000,00*0\n\nBut in reality, only **$10,000** actually changed hands \u2014 not a million.\n\n**You don\u2019t need a million dollars to create a million-dollar market cap.** You only need one small trade at a higher price, because *every other coin* is now just being \u201cvalued\u201d based on that last trade.\n\nIf you can trade even a tiny fraction of that coin, the effect is even bigger \u2014 the market cap can skyrocket with almost no actual money flowing in.\n\nSo when people say \u201cthere isn\u2019t enough money in the world for Bitcoin to reach $1M,\u201d they\u2019re misunderstanding what \u201cmarket cap\u201d actually means. It\u2019s a number derived from the *marginal price*, not the *total money invested*.",

            "selftext": "So Arkham Intelligence just dropped some interesting data about who actually holds the most Ethereum and its not what most people think.\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Deposit Contract now holds around 72.4 million ETH which is almost 60% of the current total supply. Thats worth about 250 billion dollars at current prices. This is basically all the ETH that validators have deposited to secure the network under proof of stake.\n\nWhat makes this kinda ironic is Ethereum was supposed to be super decentralized but having that much pooled in staking contracts shows how security has shifted towards a few big staking setups and protocols instead of tons of small solo holders. Whether thats good or bad depends on your perspective.\n\nFor individual holders the biggest known private owner is Rain Lohmus who bought 250k ETH back in 2014 for just 75k dollars. Problem is he lost his private keys so that roughly 871 million dollars worth of ETH is basically stuck unless he somehow recovers them. Brutal. Vitalik Buterin the co founder holds about 240k ETH.\n\nOn the institutional side Binance controls around 4.09 million ETH. BlackRocks iShares Ethereum Trust ETF sits on about 3.94 million and Coinbase holds roughly 3.5 million across its custodial and staking wallets. Other big exchanges like Upbit Kraken and OKX are also major holders.\n\nTheres even some weird stuff like the US government holding around 60k ETH mostly from seized funds. Plus a wallet tied to the 2016 Gatecoin hack is still sitting on more than 156k ETH from that exploit.\n\nBottom line is staking contracts exchanges ETF issuers and custody platforms now dominate Ethereum holdings. Decentralization meets institutional reality i guess.",

            "selftext": "American Bitcoin, the company backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, just announced they now hold 4000 BTC worth about 415 million dollars at current prices. Thats a pretty significant accumulation.\n\nThey bought nearly 170 Bitcoin between October 24 and November 5, a haul valued at more than 14 million at todays prices. Eric Trump, whos listed as co founder and chief strategy officer, said theyre building up their stack through both mining operations and direct market purchases.\n\nThis puts American Bitcoin at roughly the 25th spot among corporate Bitcoin holders. Obviously still way behind Strategy, the Michael Saylor led company formerly known as MicroStrategy, which has over 641k BTC worth around 66 billion... but its a notable position nonetheless.\n\nWhats interesting is the bigger picture of Trump family crypto exposure. Reports say theyve made roughly 1 billion dollars in pre tax gains over the last year from various crypto projects. That includes the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins which together brought in about 427 million, plus the WLFI token with around 550 million in gains.\n\nThen theres Trump Media and Technology Group, which holds more than 11500 BTC worth over 1.3 billion even tho the company is posting heavy operating losses. So theyre clearly treating Bitcoin as a reserve asset across multiple businesses.\n\nThe timing is interesting with Bitcoin sitting around 102k right now, roughly 15 percent below the all time high from early October. Mining margins are getting squeezed after the 2024 halving cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, so smaller miners are struggling... but the Trump linked ventures seem committed to accumulating regardless.\n\nWhether you like it or not, the Trump familys leaning hard into Bitcoin as a long term strategy.",

            "selftext": "The Fed will meet again in December to decide on interest rates. After a cut in October, expectations are that the central bank will proceed cautiously. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has already indicated that further rate cuts are not guaranteed.\n\nWith official data lacking, analysts are now turning to figures from companies like ADP and Indeed to gauge the labor market. Meanwhile, the Cleveland Fed is trying to estimate inflation using its own model. According to that model, inflation likely stayed around 3 percent in October, similar to September. However, this remains an estimate and cannot replace official data.\n\nEven if the government shutdown ends quickly, economists warn that the backlogs are significant. Inflation reports for October and November may arrive too late to influence the December rate decision. This means the Fed may have to make its decision without fresh data on the table.\n\nMarkets Hanging on Every Word\n\nInvestors are closely watching every word from Fed officials. Speeches from influential members, like John Williams of the New York Fed and Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed, are being scrutinized.\n\nFinancial markets are still cautiously pricing in a potential rate cut in December, but that probability is fading. Without new data, the Fed may decide to play it safe and leave rates unchanged for now.\n\nCentral banks outside the U.S. are also monitoring developments closely. This week, new data and policy statements are expected from Canada, China, the U.K., Japan, and Sweden. But in the U.S., it remains quiet.\n\nThe shutdown is not only halting data releases but also making data collection impossible. Even if Washington reopens, economists expect delays and incomplete reports.\n\nAs long as the government remains shut, the Fed must navigate without a compass.",

            "selftext": "Ethereum has been highly reliant on the Zero Knowledge Solutions like ZK Rollups. It had even bought blobs, temporary storage spaces in Ethereum L1 blocks, to reduce the cost that rollups pay to finalize their transactions on Ethereum\n\nFurther, Ethereum had also bought the Dencun Upgrade on March 13, 2024 and the Pectra Upgrade on May 7, 2025 to help rollups.\n\nHowever, a past legacy solution remains a critical bottleneck for Ethereum Scaling called the \u201cmodexp precompile\u201d.\n\nModeXP Precompile is an algorithm that enables the execution of highly complex operations, which other protocols, such as RSA, cannot perform.\n\nWhen ModeXP was created around 2017, there were no Zero Knowledge Protocols. In the current scenario, they force the Zero Knowledge Rollup to simulate the Ethereum blockchain for every transaction in a particular summary.",

I\u2019m exploring how companies can modernize employee benefits and attract younger talent through new, innovative incentives.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019m researching the idea of employers offering a crypto benefit \u2014 for example, a company giving each employee $50\u2013$100 worth of Bitcoin every month as an optional perk.\n\nThis could be similar to current voluntary benefits such as:\n\u2022stock purchase plans or 401(k) matches\n\u2022gym memberships / wellness stipends\n\u2022housing stipends\n\u2022food stipends / Uber Eats or DoorDash credits\n\u2022 transportation stipends\n\u2022tuition reimbursement\n\u2022 mental health or mindfulness programs\n\nThis is purely educational and observational research, I\u2019m not selling anything, just gathering honest input for my project.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nI\u2019d love your thoughts!\n\nPlease answer any (or all) of the questions below \ud83d\udc47\n\t1.\tHow do you feel about the idea of receiving a small amount of Bitcoin each month from your employer as a benefit?\n\n\t2.\tDo you think this would make you more likely to stay at a company or view it as more innovative? Why or why not?\n\n\t3.\tDo you think receiving Bitcoin each month would make you more likely to start investing in crypto on your own? Why or why not?\n\n\t4.\tWould you see this as a positive or negative addition to employee benefits overall?\n\n\t5.\tDo you think this type of perk would appeal more to certain groups (younger employees, tech professionals, etc.)?\n\n\t6.\tWhat potential risks or concerns do you think companies or employees might have about offering this?\n\n\t7.\tHow do you think someone who doesn\u2019t know much about crypto would view this if their company offered it \u2014 as something cool and modern, or confusing and unnecessary?\n\n\t8.\t(Optional) If you\u2019re comfortable sharing, what\u2019s your age range, industry, and country?\n\n9. From a company perspective \u2014 do you think employers could view this as a financial advantage (like a potential tax write-off or long-term retention benefit)? Why or why not?\n\nNote: This is educational research for an accelerator program I\u2019m doing through my college. If you think this idea would never work, please tell me why \u2014 honest and critical feedback is super helpful.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019ll be posting this in multiple Reddit groups to gather a diverse range of perspectives. All responses are used for research purposes only.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Whenever I discuss bitcoin with nocoiners there is always one concept that they always find hard to understand: technology by its nature is deflationary, every technological advancement either allows us to do something we could not do before, or do something more efficiently. Therefore all things over time becomes easier to produce. The cost of producing a loaf of bread today is a fraction of what it used to be. This is true of all things that are easy to produce (phones, clothes, food, everything) while things that are hard to produce (land, Picasso paintings, gold, bitcoin) are not affected the same way. Meanwhile there is inflation in the fiat monetary system that makes the currency we use worth less and less every year.  \n\nNow, the thing people find hard to understand is the way these inflationary and deflationary forces interact. People do not \"feel\" the inflation because TVs, iPhones, H&M shirts, and all other easily produced goods remain relatively cheap in fiat terms. Inflation only crosses their mind when talking about things like the housing market. But they still have a misguided view of inflation because they can still afford \"luxury goods\" like new iPhones. \n\nSo as the cost of production falls and the value of fiat currency falls with it, it acts like a masking mechanism to hide just how bad inflation actually is. It is a race to the bottom that tricks people into accepting the fact that in real terms they are far poorer than previous generations, but since they have nicer toys and access to abundant cheap to produce food they accept it.\n\nThis concept is difficult to understand, especially for people who have not done their homework. Bitcoiners often understand this once they begin to understand Austrian economis, but the average nocoiner has never thought about this before. Jeff Booth describes this perfectly in his book The price of tomorrow, but his explanation is thorough and accurate, and as a result takes a whole book to describe.\n\nTherefore I feel like we need a term to describe this concept. Giving it a name will make it easier to spread and refer to. But I don't know what that name should be.\n\nThe inflation/deflation paradox? The Overton Economy? Technological debasement? The Jeff Booth effect? Let's come up with something together.",

I think I have spent enough time on the sidelines saying I was going to buy and doing absolutely nothing about it. I remember a friend telling me to buy crypto in year 2000  and I turned my nose up on the suggestion. Maybe sticking that \u00a31k to \u00a33k in now could be something in 20yrs!\n\n",

This following year has been really tough one, and I've been burning myself to a crisp by trying to get in 4 of the most mainstream exchanges (Binance, KuCoin, and MEXC), they really weren't anything close to what I'm looking for. Every time I start to login, it's like I'm sitting indoors a plane cockpit instead of a trading screen; all those pop-ups, 47 different charts, 47 tabs screaming future/Earnings/Levy/ETF/bots/grid trading/ it all just adds together. \n\nThose extra features when you're a trader are very powerful, but for me however, it's like pain. Yeah, you see, I only tried to do all this last year because it wasn't as crazy as this year, because of the constant price swings based on the whole Crypto bubble, with it in the middleing of all the chaos in the entire investing world and it's getting harder and hard for my nerve as well.

            "selftext": "In recent years, security vulnerabilities in centralized platforms have become increasingly frequent. I believe the traditional exchange model is gradually reaching its end. For a long time, ordinary users have faced a binary choice: CEXs offer high liquidity depth but suffer from significant custodial risk, resulting in limited transparency; DEXs are completely non-custodial and on-chain auditable, but suffer from liquidity fragmentation, high gas fees, and significant user experience friction, leading to low adoption rates. Currently, neither model solves the trade-off between security, speed, and transparency. Therefore, I believe a hybrid exchange architecture will become the mainstream model in the future, combining centralized execution with decentralized settlement to balance efficiency and platform transparency.\n\nThere are many small and medium-dimension platforms trying on-chain settlement layer in my own experience investing for the past 2 years, and they have opted for insurer-backed user protection funds to secure the customer\u2019s funds. One of them called BYDFi offers a module named MoonX on its own Platform , and like that, he offers the customers a chance to swap freely from CEX mode that is symmetric with DEX mode on-chain in the same single interface. If they have more and more such platforms to follow that model, the reshaping of this entire industry should be very quick.\n\nDo you think the hybrid CEX\u2013DEX model will become the new standard? Or will the industry revert to centralized hosting as regulatory pressure and KYC enforcement intensify?",

            "selftext": "I don't get it. Every time there's a crash, you get endless comments declaring cryptocurrency is over and it will never be profitable again, that you should panic sell everything.\n\nThen, two months later, the stocks are all back up to where they were again, or even higher.\n\nAre people just shortsighted? Impatient? Unless you've invested in some kind of junk coin (99% of the market, but easily ignored), crashes are simply an opportunity to invest more and eventually reap more. Sure, it's annoying to have to wait longer for a profit, but that's no reason to proclaim the death of crypto. \n\nIn no time Bitcoin will hit another ATH, Solana will reach $240 again, and Dogecoin will be flirting with 30\u00a2. And assuming you have regular income and disposable savings, now's your chance to get in from the bottom.\n\nJoin me, friends! Let's cash out this crash out!",

            "selftext": "[](https://medium.com/@j.razo7869?source=post_page---byline--739e8b1f6d23---------------------------------------)\n\nJoseph Razo\n\n[](https://medium.com/plans?dimension=post_audio_button&postId=739e8b1f6d23&source=upgrade_membership---post_audio_button-----------------------------------------)\n\nCrypto & Fintech Writer | Blockchain Journalist | Technical Writer.\n\n*November 5th, 2025*\n\n# A Line in the Sand for Blockchain History\n\nOn\u00a0*November 3, 2025*, Algorand quietly achieved something no blockchain had ever done before: it executed the\u00a0*world\u2019s first post-quantum transaction*\u00a0on its mainnet.\n\nNo simulation, no sandbox. A real transaction, secured by\u00a0***Falcon-1024 signatures***, now lives immutably on the Algorand ledger, a transaction that even the world\u2019s most advanced future quantum computer couldn\u2019t break.\n\nFor context, this isn\u2019t just a technical milestone. It\u2019s a statement of intent, one that reshapes what blockchain security means in an era where quantum computing is no longer science fiction but an approaching inevitability.\n\n*\u201cThis isn\u2019t theory anymore,\u201d*\u00a0I added.\u00a0*\u201cAlgorand has crossed the bridge. The rest of the industry is still building.\u201d*\n\n# Why Quantum Resistance Matters\n\nTo understand why this moment matters, you need to understand the risk. Nearly every blockchain today, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even most of the newer ones, relies on\u00a0*RSA*\u00a0or\u00a0*elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)*\u00a0to verify ownership and authenticate transactions. These systems work beautifully against classical computers.\n\nBut against a quantum computer? They crumble.\n\nSince\u00a0*Peter Shor\u2019s algorithm*\u00a0in\u00a0***1994***\u00a0proved that a sufficiently powerful quantum machine could factor large numbers or compute discrete logarithms instantly, cryptographers have known what\u2019s coming. It\u2019s not a matter of\u00a0*if*, but\u00a0*when*.\n\nThe danger isn\u2019t just futuristic. There\u2019s what security experts call the\u00a0*\u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d*\u00a0problem. Bad actors can collect encrypted blockchain data today, store it, and wait until quantum machines mature, then decrypt everything at once.\n\nWhen that day comes, every wallet, signature, and identity built on today\u2019s encryption could be compromised.\n\nThis is why Algorand\u2019s step isn\u2019t about bragging rights. It\u2019s about survival and foresight.\n\n# Falcon: The Cryptographic Shield of the Future\n\nAt the heart of this breakthrough is\u00a0***Falcon,***\u00a0a lattice-based signature algorithm co-developed by cryptographic heavyweights like\u00a0*Craig Gentry, Chris Peikert*, and\u00a0*Vinod Vaikuntanathan,*\u00a0with contributions from Algorand\u2019s own\u00a0*Dr. Zhenfei Zhang*.\n\nFalcon, which stands for\u00a0*Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU*, was selected by\u00a0*NIST in 2022*\u00a0as a global standard for post-quantum digital signatures.\n\nIt\u2019s efficient, compact, and incredibly hard to break even for quantum computers.\n\nFalcon comes in two main versions:\n\n* ***Falcon-512***, offering AES-128-level security.\n* ***Falcon-1024***, providing AES-192-level strength \u2014 what NIST calls\u00a0*\u201cLevel 5,\u201d*\u00a0the highest security tier available.\n\nAlgorand uses Falcon-1024. It\u2019s the same signature scheme that already protects Algorand\u2019s\u00a0*state proofs,*compact cryptographic snapshots that allow other blockchains to verify Algorand\u2019s state without intermediaries.\n\nThe genius here lies in Falcon\u2019s balance:\n\n* Its signatures are larger (around 1,280 bytes) but extremely fast to verify (under 100 microseconds).\n* Signing takes more computation, but verification, the part blockchains do millions of times per day, is lightning-quick.\n\nThat trade-off is perfect for Algorand, where every block involves thousands of signature checks per second.\n\n# Engineering the Impossible\n\nImplementing Falcon in production wasn\u2019t as simple as swapping one signature scheme for another.\n\nFalcon uses\u00a0*floating-point arithmetic*\u00a0and\u00a0*Fast Fourier transforms,*\u00a0techniques that demand incredible numerical precision. One rounding error, and security could fail.\n\nThe Algorand Foundation\u2019s team tackled this with a deterministic, constant-time implementation, ensuring no randomness or timing leaks that attackers could exploit.\n\nTheir guiding principles were clear:\n\n1. ***No disruption to consensus:***\u00a0verification had to remain deterministic.\n2. ***Seamless integration:***\u00a0of quantum-secure accounts is needed to act like normal ones.\n3. ***Developer accessibility:***\u00a0the system should be easy to use and experiment with.\n\nTo achieve that, Algorand built something elegant: embedding Falcon keys inside\u00a0*Logic Signatures*\u00a0smart contracts that control how an account\u2019s funds can be spent.\n\nThese contracts verify Falcon signatures over transaction IDs. If the math checks out, the spend is authorized.\n\nFrom the network\u2019s perspective, it looks no different from a traditional account only it\u2019s\u00a0*quantum-secure*.\n\n# Building the Tools for a Quantum Future\n\nTo make this accessible, Algorand released the\u00a0***Falcon Signatures CLI,***\u00a0a command-line toolkit that lets developers actually create, fund, and transact from post-quantum accounts on mainnet or testnet.\n\nDevelopers can:\n\n* Generate Falcon keypairs\n* Derive Algorand addresses from them\n* Fund those addresses\n* Sign and submit Falcon-verified transactions\n\nIn other words, anyone can now mint, sign, and send quantum-resistant transactions.\n\nThat\u2019s not just innovation, it\u2019s democratization of security.\n\n# What\u2019s Protected \u2014 and What Isn\u2019t (Yet)\n\nAlgorand\u2019s post-quantum rollout secures individual accounts and the blockchain\u2019s historical state. State proofs \u2014 those compact summaries used by other chains \u2014 are now fully quantum-resistant.\n\nBut the\u00a0*consensus layer*\u00a0still relies on\u00a0*Ed25519*\u00a0signatures and\u00a0**V***erifiable Random Functions (VRFs)*\u00a0for validator selection. These are classical cryptographic mechanisms that quantum computers could theoretically exploit.\n\nSo while quantum attackers couldn\u2019t steal funds from Falcon-secured accounts, they might still disrupt block proposals or manipulate future consensus events.\n\nThat\u2019s why Algorand\u2019s approach is\u00a0*incremental but deliberate*: start with user-level protection, gain experience, then move up the stack toward quantum-secure consensus.\n\nIt\u2019s the practical path to secure what\u2019s possible now and evolve systematically.\n\n# Falcon\u2019s Broader Impact\n\nFalcon\u2019s adoption by Algorand has implications far beyond a single blockchain.\n\nBecause it\u2019s\u00a0*NIST-standardized*, Falcon can act as a\u00a0*universal language*\u00a0for cross-chain communication in a\u00a0*post-quantum world.*\n\nAlgorand\u2019s\u00a0*state proofs*, already powered by Falcon, could allow other chains to verify data trustlessly with the same cryptographic standard, no intermediaries needed.\n\nThat sets the stage for a\u00a0*quantum-resistant multichain future*\u00a0where interoperability and security coexist instead of colliding.\n\nThe open-source Falcon CLI also invites global collaboration developers, cryptographers, even universities can study and improve the system freely.\n\n# The Human Side: Algorand\u2019s 2025 Roadmap\n\nWhile the Falcon achievement represents Algorand\u2019s technical peak, its\u00a0*2025 roadmap*\u00a0reveals something just as profound: a shift toward simplicity, usability, and community control.\n\nIn an industry drowning in jargon and fractured ecosystems, Algorand\u2019s message is refreshingly human. The roadmap centers around three core goals:\n\n1. ***Return power to the community***\n2. ***Make blockchain development frictionless***\n3. ***Deliver a user experience that feels like Web2 \u2014 but runs on Web3 principles***\n\n# Community Takes the Wheel\n\nAlgorand is handing the steering wheel to its users.\n\nThrough\u00a0*Project King Safety*, the network plans to redesign its fee and incentive model to ensure long-term sustainability, ending the era of foundation-subsidized economics. A position paper is due in\u00a0*Q4 2025*, outlining how fees, validator rewards, and network incentives will evolve.\n\nEven more transformative is the\u00a0*revival of its grant program*\u00a0under a\u00a0*new governance structure.*\n\nA community-elected\u00a0*xGov Council*\u00a0will now decide which projects get funding \u2014 removing centralized gatekeeping and restoring grassroots governance.\n\nThe foundation has already\u00a0*reduced its stake from 63% to 21%*\u00a0through a new rewards model, and a\u00a0*peer-to-peer gossip network*\u00a0is replacing its centralized relay architecture.\n\nEach of these steps pushes Algorand closer to becoming a\u00a0*fully peer-to-peer, self-governed ecosystem,*something most blockchains only claim to be.\n\n# Simplifying the Developer Experience\n\nThe next frontier is making blockchain development as easy as writing a mobile app.\n\nIn\u00a0*early 2026*, Algorand will launch\u00a0*AlgoKit 4.0,*\u00a0a major upgrade that introduces composable smart contract libraries, key-value storage\u00a0*(\u201cSchema\u201d)*, and native support for mainstream languages like\u00a0***Rust****,*\u00a0***Swift***, and\u00a0***Kotlin***.\n\nDevelopers will even be able to use\u00a0***AI assistants***, powered by large language models, to help write and debug contracts, merging artificial intelligence and blockchain into a single development flow.\n\n*\u201cAlgorand is building a bridge for developers who don\u2019t want to learn ten new programming languages just to build on Web3.\u201d*\n\nFor enterprises,\u00a0*Intermezzo*, debuting in\u00a0*Q3 2025*, will handle all the hard stuff: key management, blockchain integration, and compliance. Businesses will be able to launch blockchain-backed loyalty programs, digital assets, or identity systems with almost no technical friction.\n\nAnd for users? That\u2019s where\u00a0*Rocca Wallet*\u00a0comes in.\n\n# Rocca Wallet: Web3 Without the Headache\n\nIf Falcon is the brain of Algorand\u2019s evolution,\u00a0*Rocca Walle***t**\u00a0is its face.\n\nSet for\u00a0*preview in Q4 2025*\u00a0and an\u00a0*open-source release in 2026*, Rocca aims to eliminate one of the biggest pain points in the crypto complex: intimidating wallets.\n\nIt supports\u00a0*passkey logins*\u00a0(no seed phrases),\u00a0*fee abstraction*\u00a0(users don\u2019t even see\u00a0*\u201cgas*\u201d), and\u00a0*decentralized identity*\u00a0(no centralized logins or data leaks).\n\nIt\u2019s also\u00a0*white-label*, meaning DApps can brand and customize it so the blockchain experience can fade into the background, letting usability take center stage.\n\nIn short, Rocca makes Web3 feel like Web2 only safer, faster, and fully decentralized.\n\n# Powering the Real World\n\nAlgorand\u2019s 2025 vision also extends beyond the screen. It\u2019s targeting real industries where blockchain can quietly improve everyday life:\n\n1. ***Tokenized Financial Products*****:**\u00a0Using the\u00a0*ACTUS framework*, Algorand is building smart contract models for tokenized debt and equity, with a\u00a0*Debt ASA MVP*\u00a0expected by\u00a0*Q4 2025*.\n2. ***Agentic Commerce*****:**\u00a0Supporting AI agents that can transact autonomously via\u00a0***X402***\u00a0and\u00a0*A2A payments,*\u00a0blurring the line between AI and DeFi.\n3. ***Self-Sovereign Identity*****:**\u00a0The Rocca Wallet will enable verifiable credentials \u2014 like\u00a0*WorldChess\u2019s Universal Chess Passport*, which lets players compete globally without centralized logins.\n4. ***Data Integrity*****:**\u00a0Strengthening blockchain\u2019s role as a permanent, verifiable record for supply chains, enterprises, and beyond.\n\n# Privacy, Scalability, and the Quantum Edge\n\nAlgorand isn\u2019t just catching up \u2014 it\u2019s leaping ahead.\n\nIts upgraded\u00a0***AlgoPlonk***\u00a0zero-knowledge system will make privacy faster and more flexible, while exploration into\u00a0*multiparty computation (MPC)*\u00a0and\u00a0*fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)*\u00a0lays the groundwork for transactions that remain private even while being processed.\n\nMeanwhile,\u00a0*parallel execution*\u00a0and\u00a0*block pipelining*\u00a0are set to supercharge scalability, allowing multiple transactions to run at once and cutting block confirmation times even further.\n\nAnd in the background, Falcon remains the silent guardian expanding from state proofs to user accounts, making Algorand one of the\u00a0*first truly quantum-resistant blockchains on Earth.*\n\n# How Algorand Could Shield Bitcoin and Other Networks from Quantum Threats\n\nIf the crypto industry ever faced a unified existential risk, it would be the moment a quantum computer gains the power to crack traditional cryptography. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other networks rely on elliptic-curve signatures that a large enough quantum machine could break in hours.\n\nBut what if a blockchain already designed for quantum resistance could act as a\u00a0*guardian layer,*\u00a0a protective framework capable of verifying and securing other chains until they upgrade?\n\nThat\u2019s precisely where\u00a0***Algorand***\u00a0could step in.\n\nThrough its\u00a0***Falcon-based state proofs***\u00a0and advanced cross-chain verification capabilities, Algorand could become a\u00a0***quantum-safe validation hub*****,**\u00a0a kind of digital shield for legacy blockchains. Its post-quantum signatures could authenticate wrapped or bridged assets, allowing\u00a0*BTC, ETH, or other vulnerable coins*\u00a0to operate within a\u00a0*quantum-secure environment*\u00a0without needing to overhaul their original codebases overnight.\n\nImagine Bitcoin wrapped inside Algorand\u2019s lattice-secured ecosystem, its ownership and movement verified by Falcon signatures, insulated from quantum decryption threats. The original Bitcoin chain could continue as it is, but its value, liquidity, and transaction flow could be mirrored through Algorand\u2019s\u00a0*quantum-proof framework,*\u00a0preserving the integrity of BTC without disrupting its core protocol.\n\n*\u201cIf Algorand were allowed to serve as a security layer for Bitcoin,\u201d*\u00a0I noted,\u00a0*\u201cit could buy the entire crypto industry time, maybe years, even decades to transition safely into a post-quantum era.\u201d*\n\nThis kind of hybrid interoperability could extend to\u00a0*stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi protocols, and cross-border payment rails*\u00a0as well. Since Algorand\u2019s state proofs already support\u00a0*trustless communication across chains*, Falcon could underpin a multi-network safety web, one where any blockchain, even those not quantum-ready, could plug into Algorand for verification and data integrity.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold idea, but one rooted in reality. Algorand\u2019s technology isn\u2019t just future-proofing itself; it could very well be\u00a0*future-proofing everyone else*, too.\n\n# Staying True to Web3\u2019s Promise\n\nWhile other networks chase hype cycles, Algorand is quietly rebuilding Web3 around its original ideals:\n\n* *Transparency*\n* *Security*\n* *Community-led governance*\n* *Sustainability*\n\nIts uptime is near-flawless. Its scalability remains unmatched. And now, its cryptography is preparing for a world that doesn\u2019t even exist yet.\n\n# A Glimpse at the Horizon\n\nAlgorand\u2019s latest moves, both technical and philosophical, signal a maturation of blockchain as an industry.\n\nFalcon\u2019s integration shows that cutting-edge cryptography can coexist with usability.  \nThe 2025 roadmap proves that decentralization and human-centered design aren\u2019t opposites; they\u2019re the same path forward.\n\nTogether, they redefine what\u00a0*\u201cWeb3 readiness\u201d*\u00a0really means.\n\nIt\u2019s not about speculation. It\u2019s about\u00a0*security that lasts decades, governance that empowers real people*, and\u00a0*tools that anyone can use without a manual.*\n\nAlgorand\u2019s post-quantum transaction didn\u2019t just future-proof a blockchain, it\u00a0*future-proofed the idea of trust itself.*\n\n# The Final Word\n\nFor all the industry talk about quantum threats, decentralized AI, and next-gen networks, only one blockchain has proven it\u2019s ready for the next era: Algorand.\n\nFrom\u00a0*Falcon\u2019s lattice-based cryptography*\u00a0to the\u00a0*Rocca Wallet\u2019s human-friendly design*, the network is merging the unthinkable military-grade security with intuitive simplicity.\n\n*\u201cWhat Algorand did isn\u2019t just technical brilliance, it\u2019s vision,\u201d*\u00a0I concluded.\u00a0*\u201cThey\u2019re showing the world that security, decentralization, and user experience can finally coexist. It\u2019s the evolution Web3 has been waiting for.\u201d*\n\n# A Note on the Road Ahead\n\nQuantum computers are coming. AI is accelerating.  \nBut for once, blockchain isn\u2019t lagging behind innovation; it\u2019s leading it.\n\nAnd at the front of that pack, with its post-quantum Falcon wings already spread, stands\u00a0***Algorand.***\u00a0*Don\u2019t give up on the underdog yet! This blockchain could surprise everyone at the end.*\n\nBecause the future doesn\u2019t wait, and Algorand has decided it won\u2019t either.\n\nSources:\n\n[Young, L. (2025, November 3).

That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.

I had not realized my profits yet because I was hoping ETH was going higher.\n\nTo make sure I would not make a loss, I put a stop-loss order at $3100.\n\nThe drop this week kissed the $3100 mark. When you look at the chart, for about 10 minutes or so, the price was at or below $3100, which made my order activate and sell all my ETH. In hindsight, I should have created multiple orders at different price ranges to DCA out of the market.\n\nI am frustrated because I basically lost out on all my profits I could have made. It was no crazy amount and I am content with not losing any of my money, however it just sucks seeying the price back at $3400+ in just a few days. \n\nShould I step back into the market and buy back my ETH, even though I would buy back at a loss? Or take this as a valuable lesson on how to place orders to minize losses and maximize profit?",

            "selftext": "I'm noodling on the question of which direction wealth inequality would trend if and when the world transitions to a bitcoin standard (i.e. elimination of fiat currencies or a fiat currency system that is fully pegged to bitcoin). The context for the question is: I believe that wealth inequality is the most pernicious characteristic of a civilization and is what is driving the political and social malaise that we are currently experiencing in the West. I believe that inflation exacerbates wealth inequality, which is what initially attracted me to bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWhat I'd like to be true is that, under a bitcoin standard, we would trend towards more equal wealth distribution, unlike what has happened in the West since the abandonment of Bretton Woods, during which time (1971 - today), inequality has been rising. My understanding is that in order for wealth inequality to decline, returns to labor would need to be higher than returns to capital. I don't expect this to be the case, even under a bitcoin standard, because of the progress of technology and the resulting high returns to capital relative to returns to labor.\n\n  \n**So, my question is**: does bitcoin give you hope not just for a redistribution of wealth from political insiders to bitcoin hodlers, but also for a world which will permanently trend towards equality? Because a world trending towards equality, whose people are becoming more and more like each other (from a socioeconomic perspective), more and more harmonious, would be very beautiful. Or will life under a bitcoin standard, assuming we can achieve that, be similar to today's world, just with a (slightly) different group of really rich people?",

            "selftext": "ZKSync\u2019s Atlas upgrade has reached 15,000 transactions per second and about one-second finality between all ZK Stack chains. The system connects Ethereum\u2019s mainnet and its L2s into a shared network where transactions and liquidity can move almost instantly while still settling back to Ethereum\u2019s base layer.\n\nBefore Atlas, activity on rollups happened in isolation. Transfers between L2s required bridging, often taking hours or days. Atlas establishes ZK-verified communication between chains, removing those delays and giving Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem near-instant internal synchronization.\n\nBeyond throughput, Atlas also changes how capital moves onchain. Assets like ETH, USDC, or stETH can now remain on mainnet as live collateral while being used across connected chains. A trader on GRVT \u2014 the first exchange using Atlas \u2014 can post margin or settle trades backed directly by funds still held on Ethereum. Because of sub-second verification between L2s and roughly 10\u201315 minute L1 finality, positions can be updated and verified on Ethereum faster than any centralized exchange settlement.\n\nBeyond GRVT, another project applies the same logic at a broader scale. Lighter\u2019s Universal Cross Margin system extends the model, letting any Ethereum-based asset \u2014 including ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or lending positions \u2014 serve as trading collateral without leaving mainnet. The assets stay on Ethereum, continue to earn yield, and are referenced through zero-knowledge proofs on Lighter\u2019s Layer 2.\n\nEvery operation, from order matching to liquidation, is verified cryptographically on Ethereum rather than through bridges or custodians. This turns Ethereum itself into the universal margin ledger while execution happens off-chain. The result is the same pattern seen with GRVT and Atlas: higher-performance layers forming around Ethereum without detaching from its security or liquidity base.\n\nAcross Layer 2 chains, we're seeing the first prototypes of cross-asset margining operating in real time. This promises a world where liquidity that was previously locked in silos can be used simultaneously on multiple venues. Each transaction updates instantly across the network, with Ethereum providing the final source of truth.\n\nThe effect is that the Ethereum ecosystem begins to operate less like it a collection of fragmented chains, and more like a single network of connected execution layers \u2014 each specialized, but all secured by the same base. Instead of competing L2s, Atlas and Lighter make them part of one market bus.\n\nIn parallel, EigenCloud demonstrates the same consolidation on the compute side. It turns Web2 backends into verifiable smart-contract services secured by Ethereum. It reduces the cost of launching decentralized applications by using ETH as the universal security bond and keeping familiar Web2 interfaces like email login or off-chain computation.\n\nTogether, these developments show Ethereum scaling by integration rather than duplication \u2014 bringing verifiable applications and high-throughput trading into a single security domain, with ETH as the settlement asset that connects them all.\n\n\nSources:\n\n1\\.

Because when we say something has \"value,\" it usually means that the thing itself is useful to someone in some way. But in this case, that expression is a complete linguistic deception, because any benefit to any holder can only come from a new investor. It makes no sense.\n\nIf we look at every other thing in the world, from the trivial to the monumental, each has some real usefulness.\n\nA record of air temperature is useful to a meteorologist, a recipe to a cook, a song to a listener; oil, gold, and wheat are useful to industry and consumers. Shares are useful to those who receive dividends or liquidation proceeds. Land is useful to everyone because people need somewhere to live. Virtual things like video games or films are useful because they provide enjoyment to many.\n\nEven fiat money, which many say \"is not valuable unless others accept it on the market,\" has functional usefulness in itself: it is issued as bank debt and can therefore erase that debt. This is a concrete value for anyone who owes banks; it can be used to pay off mortgages, reduce, or fully settle a loan. Everything without \"market acceptance\".\n\nAnd this?\n\nIt can do none of that. No one, absolutely no one, can gain any benefit from what they bought itself. The only \"benefit\" comes when you sell it to a new investor. So what they call \"the value of X\" is not its value at all; it is simply what the new buyer gives to the old holder. In other words, it\u2019s not the value of it, it\u2019s the value of someone else\u2019s deposit.\n\nAnd to keep that going, the world spends enormous amounts of energy, real, measurable, precious energy, just so people can keep dumping it to one another. That means physical resources of the planet are being burned to sustain a mechanism for reselling nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s like a civilizational glitch: humanity has invented a way to consume energy merely to maintain the illusion that others will gift them more useful things than they themselves have given away.\n\nIt\u2019s not just useless, it is the absolute negation of meaning. It turns energy into nothing, while people call that nothing \"value.\"\n\nIt is proof of collective madness that people still value **gold.**\n\n(the above is a nearly word-for-word rant from a crypto hater / gold lover) - with exception of replacing bitcoin with gold.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Bitcoin has left many people on the sidelines while others experienced a return on investment of 100x or more. This isn\u2019t about envy or regret \u2014 it\u2019s about acknowledging that many who believe in Bitcoin\u2019s ideals simply missed the early window.\n\nMy message is one of sincere hope for those who still want to join the journey when they feel ready \u2014 when they have learned enough, saved enough, and built the conviction to enter with intention. A renewed and youthful phase for Bitcoin might require a price floor accessible to the many, not the few.\n\nBitcoin has to meet the expectations of new investors \u2014 especially young people aged 18 to 35 who were financially unable to invest during the favorable price levels of previous cycles (such as the 2019 lows). People like me, who couldn\u2019t even afford to accumulate 1.5 BTC back then, should still have a realistic chance to participate at some point in their lives. Life doesn\u2019t guarantee financial comfort. Not everyone will have a retirement to rely on. Bitcoin should represent an opportunity for all \u2014 a new chance waiting for those who are prepared when the time comes.\n\nFor Bitcoin to truly fulfill its revolution and unite investors across the world, it needs broader adoption, deeper stability, and a widely accepted consensus value going into 2025/2026.\n\nI believe that Bitcoin cannot be analyzed only on a short timeline like 5 years. Yes, its 4-year cycle guides expectations, and some predict $1M per BTC. Personally, my projection stays below $500K because Bitcoin remains volatile and still maturing. It is possible we are living through a bubble today \u2014 one that could reset to $50K or even lower. And maybe that reset is not something to fear, but something that renews Bitcoin\u2019s foundation.\n\nIf future cycles lengthen and Bitcoin\u2019s price evolution starts resembling something closer to gold \u2014 smoother, more stable, less emotional \u2014 then a new, wider entry point could be the key to bringing more long-term holders into the ecosystem.\n\nThe essence of Bitcoin should not be driven by the pursuit of sudden exponential wealth. Its legacy will come from becoming a reliable, global store of value held by a broad share of the population \u2014 not just early adopters and institutional investors.\n\nIf Bitcoin is to become truly resilient and \u201cimmortal\u201d in the face of global uncertainty, then perhaps it will need to experience periodic resets \u2014 once every few decades \u2014 giving each generation the chance to step into the ideal, to become part of the story, and to carry it forward.\n\nA new golden age of Bitcoin may not come from a parabolic surge, but from a moment of accessibility \u2014 a doorway opened to the world.",

Here\u2019s why:\n\n\u2022 Data looks nice but tells you nothing. You get outputs, not context. They never really explain how the mapping works, so you\u2019re just staring at charts without knowing what any of it means.\n\n\u2022 Conversions were dead. I tried targeting the lists they gave  nothing. Looked great on paper, but no actual users showed up. \n\n\u2022 I used  different setups and had the same results. I ran a few totally different campaigns inside Addressable, and the reports ended up looking almost identical. Doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201csmart targeting.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Support is MIA. You ask one detailed question, and they hit you back with a copy-paste FAQ. It felt like talking to a wall.\n\n\u2022 Pricing\u2019s a joke. You\u2019re basically dropping hundreds on what feels like a dressed-up spreadsheet of wallet IDs.\n\n\u2022 Still using old logic. The whole system feels stuck in early-Web3 thinking as if surface-level wallet data alone can tell you real intent.\n\nTL;DR  - Looks sleek, costs a ton, and leaves you guessing. Save your budget for something that actually moves numbers.",

            "selftext": "Looking at the new regulations due to come into effect in January 2026 if you value your privacy you\u2019d want to be removing your coins from exchanges and putting them in cold storage. \n\n*tldr: Under DAC 8 (and CARF aligned frameworks) EU jurisdictions will require crypto-asset service providers to disclose user data along with their transaction data to tax authorities.*\n\n*The EU approach means these obligations will be not just domestic but cross-border (service providers in one jurisdiction may have to report for users resident elsewhere).*\n\nThe rules specifically state **\u201cany user data\u201d** and **\u201dany transaction data\u201d** to **\u201dcompetent authorities\u201d**. Basically, the difference from then and now is if the \u201ccompetent authorities\u201d want your information and data they need a court order or warrant but from 2026 on they need absolutely nothing. In fact they don\u2019t even have to request it. The exchange will automatically provide it to them. \n\n**The pros:**\n\n-It should reduce the amount of scams / money laundering / criminality associated with crypto carried out by criminals in the EU. \u201cFollowing the money\u201d will be a lot easier for the authorities in an investigation. Although Id imagine tax is their main motive with these new rules. \n\n**The cons:**\n\nYour privacy is totally wiped. Once your coins are bought / sold / moved, the government will know all about it. Yes there is always P2P but if it\u2019s facilitated through any 3rd party business which most are, it\u2019s no longer anonymous. \n\nI don\u2019t do anything illegal and pay my taxes but i do value my privacy. I don\u2019t like the idea of people knowing exactly what and when I buy and sell. \n\n\n\n",

After looking it up im seeing that i need to enter all the crypto transactions that were buying / selling / reward / mining. That's around 200 transactions for me.\n\nI found Koinly the web site, not the app its a scam. It says it can do what i need done but its going to be an extra $100 on my taxes just to file staking and mining earning for around $18. Is there any way to avoid paying that for such a small amount. I honestly thought the taxes would be i made this much lost that much and done.\n\n  \nAlso please only genuine answers, no hate speech. I'm really being caught in a well crap situation. ",

I know it has gone lower historically. But I do not feel scared. I definitely will not paperhand as I do not need the money, it's meant for retirement. I just feel shitty that my average is high, but that's hindsight.\n\nAny advice? Should I just be patient and DCA instead of taking the loan?",

            "selftext": "Parallax is a new blockchain that was launched on the 28th of October with its token being named LAX.\n\nThis is a Proof of Work blockchain that runs on the XHash algorithm being ASIC resistant for now, not allowing ASICs to overflow the initial hashrate. \n\nParallax has a fixed supply of 21 million tokens and a 10 minute block time just like Bitcoin but it is a EVM compatible blockchain meaning that it can be highly progamable like Ethereum. It's important to note that there was no premine and the main developer didn't take any allocation of the first issued tokens to himself, allowing miners to distribute all the rewards.\n\nLAX preserves the cypherpunk Ethos aiming to be highly decentralized and community driven. It also allows to combine Bitcoin's fixed rules for money with Ethereum progammable environment.\n\nBeing full EVM compatible allows users to add the wallet straight to Metamask using the following instructions to create a custom network in Metamask.\n\nNetwork name: Parallax\n\nRPC: https://rpc.parallaxchain.org\n\nChain ID: 2110\n\nSymbol: LAX\n\nExplorer: https://explorer.parallaxchain.org\n\nAfter adding this to Metamask, users all fully able to send, receive and sign transactions in Metamask.\n\nAlthough it's in its infancy, LAX has already gather the attention of many small exchanges and has a respectfull volume right now, the price is about 0.5$ per LAX at the time of writing and the hashrate has been constantly rising in the last few days. Listing in Safe Trade is already confirmed and should be done in a few days, being a much larger exchange it should attract a lot more volume to LAX.\n\nParallax is different from the usual launch of coins because of its fair launch and deserves being named just because of its fairness in a world populated with VCs and premined cryptocurrencies.\n\nAll the details about the blockchain can be found on https://parallaxchain.org.",

And I really can not comprehend who in their right mind would buy something useless like that, much less put their whole savings on that or for example the hawk tuah coin. Memecoins like that have 0(ZERO) value, they don't do anything for you. At least with the TRUMP coin you could get invited to a shitty dinner. \n\nFrom my understanding people who lose savings in situations like this are people who know absolutely nothing about crypto? Like why do people invest in something they know nothing about just because a brat on the internet shilled it?\n\nSecond question, coins like this are at first not available on easy to access CEXes, but to use a DEX you at least have to have a minimum of crypto knowledge.\n\nCan someone please enlighten me about this fascinating topic?",

            "selftext": "**Hey everyone,**\u00a0I recently built a website/app using AI tools, and I'd love to get your honest feedback on it. Do you think it's something useful that people would actually use, or does it seem like a total miss? I've been testing it out myself and finding it helpful, but I'm curious about what others in the community think.A bit of backstory: Like a lot of folks here, I tend to panic sell during market downturns, and I needed a way to step back and clear my head from all the volatility. That's when I discovered some AI platforms that make it super easy to build websites and apps. It turned my rough idea into a real, functional thing pretty quickly \u2013 no coding expertise required on my end. Now, I'm wondering if this could resonate with others facing similar challenges. Before I shell out the $300 to take it live as a proper .com domain, I wanted to run it by you all on Reddit first. If the feedback is mostly negative, I'll probably scrap the idea and save my money. Check it out here:\u00a0[website](https://cryptobtn-kkgkropo.manus.space/)\u00a0\u2013 feel free to poke around and let me know your thoughts! What works? What doesn't? Any suggestions for improvements, new features, or tweaks? I'd really appreciate any input \u2013 thanks for taking the time to read this and share your perspective! Looking forward to the discussion.\n\n  \n",

He\u2019s always been under the impression that since he originally provided the funds, when it came time to sell, there wouldn\u2019t be any major fees involved.\n\nHowever, his father who also purchased his own Bitcoin around two years ago is now saying that to sell the 5 BTC\u2019s will be a huge fee. He also stated that if he wanted to send the Bitcoin from his account and send us the proceeds then he\u2019d have to pay another huge fee in networking cost. I\u2019m a bit confused about this. \n\nCan someone please clarify whether that\u2019s true, and what kind of fees (if any) should realistically apply when selling Bitcoin from Coinbase? I just want to ensure that his father isn\u2019t taking advantage of us. \n",

            "selftext": "I have my funds split between a Trezor and Ledger, with backup devices for both.\n\n Having a backup device makes sense, let's say you had some ETH on your ledger and it went and hit 10k and you wanted to sell, but your device got damaged somehow and now you have to wait for your new device to arrive in the mail. By the time you get the device, regain access by using your seeds ETH has tanked by 50% lol.\n\nHowever, at a certain point I think having too many different addresses can be an issue or even outright unnecessary. If you properly secured your seeds, why would you need 10 different wallet addresses? I feel like it would be easy to misplace something or make some sort of error where you ultimately lose access to your holdings.\n\nThoughts?",

That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.\n> \n> > Quote from: bytemaster on July 28, 2010, 08:59:42 PM\n> > Besides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good.

You started meetups, made lifelong friends, launched businesses together, found jobs, and yes, somebody even got married. \ud83e\udde1\n\nWe've watched this community grow from an idea into a movement, and it's shown us something important: the orange pill is just the beginning.\n\nWhat matters more is what comes after, the real connections, the in-person community, the place where Bitcoiners actually meet & build together.\n\nThat's why today, Orange Pill App is becoming Club Orange.\n\nNew name. Same mission: a home for Bitcoiners, everywhere.\n\nThis is just the start of a bigger vision, and we can't wait to share what's coming next.\n\nWelcome to Club Orange. \u26a1\ufe0f\n\nP.S.

            "selftext": "A view i've held for quite some time is that Crypto hasn't seen it's final leg up purely because of the overperformance of Nasdaq and S&P - it's the elephant in the room, a blocker and largely because of the Tech stocks offering better returns on a risk adjusted basis.\n\nThe images shared show the returns from Jan '25 till now versus Jan '24 till now with and without the magnificent 7. In short, the Magnificent 7 are pretty much contributing to majority of the index gains this year to date - without them the returns are modest/expected. \n\nIn my view, the overperformance of the Magnificent 7 makes it difficult for retail and institutions to divert capital to crypto when risk adjusted returns are considered. \n\nAs of the last week or so, we've seen a correction to some of the Magnificent 7 stocks along with similar peers which in turn brings down the Nasdaq and S&P. Crypto is still a closely associated asset class to Equities so unfortunately, that's why when the those indexes sell off, we see a sell-off in Crypto. However, that is coming to an end.\n\nAs this correction and profit taking occurs, the risk adjusted return actually goes back to normalcy - or rather Crypto becomes a lot more appealing and in the coming weeks or month we should see the final leg. \n\nThis is quite a unique phenomenon that's never happened in prior cycles and it's really this that has got youtubers/chartists confused.\n\nThe bull cycle isn't over, we've been side-lined whilst our hooves are being repaired and it's looking like go time!\n\nNote: Data courtesy of chatgpt.",

            "selftext": "Good article for a deep dive on the challenges faced with making the cryptography upgrades that all systems will need to implement.\n\nA handful of projects have been emphasizing the importance of protecting assets with post quantum cryptography. Here are some updates:\n\nQANX completed audit of it's virtual machine- enabling smart contracts to be created using nearly all programming languages.  Xlink audit due any day- This allows hybrid/cross-signing with PQC using existing evm wallets like metamask and trust.  Recent news includes Ueno bank using the SignQuantum solution (powered by Qanplatform) and joining Blockchain for Europe.  CTO to speak on Dec 3\n\nQRL continues project Zond development and testing.  Added Bitmart exchange and saw significant price movement before retreating over the last few weeks.  ETA on Zond audit/delivery is still not known, but this aims to create evm compatibility and move the chain to proof of stake.\n\nCELL continues to decline significantly after a surge back in Jan.  There appear to be some reasons that could be sorted out, but don't have all the details.  Requires some deeper digging for those wanting to know.\n\nA project called NAORIS shows up in the cmc list now as well.  Was quite volatile to start.  Claims it can provide post quantum security to existing chains, which based on the shared article would not seem to be a one size fits all solution, nor very straight forward.  Gaining consensus from any project on how to move forward is the biggest challenge.\n\nAs always, people will mention projects like HBAR, SOL, ETH, ALGO which have talked about how they might transition, but none have implemented post quantum digital signatures in their projects.  Also note while QANX is listed as having built for PQC, it is still in audit phase and an estimated mainnet date is expected any day now.",

            "selftext": "Alright, I've been thinking about it, and no matter how much I do, I don't get the point of hardware wallets.\n\nFor me, there are a few use cases (I'm disregarding illicit ones) for cryptocurrencies in general:\n\n1. Investing into them long-term. Holding some part of your wealth in Bitcoin or whatever you think is best for that. You don't plan on selling any of it for 10 years+. You may or may not have the extra conviction to have full control over your assets.\n2. Investing into them, but on a shorter timeframe. You want to hold some of your wealth there, but eventually, you might want to withdraw some, but not all the time.\n3. Holding some of it and borrowing against it to pay daily bills.\n4. Using it for paying for stuff on the internet. It's kind of an edge case right now, but it does happen.\n5. Transferring money between countries with no common or dysfunctional banking systems.\n6. Trading, either on centralized exchanges or on decentralized exchanges.\n\nPoint 3 isn't really possible with self-custody anyway, your assets are collateral, that means it will be in some custodial wallet. This is out for a hardware wallet.\n\nPoint 4 you want convenience. Connecting a hardware wallet every time you make a transaction is annoying, and you'll probably not hold a significant portion of your wealth in such a wallet. For a small wallet for active transactions, a hot wallet (custodial or self-custodial) seems most reasonable, no point in a hardware wallet.\n\nPoint 5 is similar to the former point. You're holding the money for a short time, a hardware wallet would be more of an inconvenience and you don't gain much from it. But I can see how it can feel cool for some, I don't see the point in it.\n\nPoint 6, a hardware wallet makes little sense. Tradinc on a centralized exchange is custodial anyway, and decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, you can use with a hardware wallet, but this isn't the place for long-term investments, so the size argument probably is key here again. I don't see the big benefit there.\n\nPoint 1, a hardware wallet makes no sense to me. You don't need a hardware wallet to put money into it. You're not withdrawing for years anyway, and you need to backup your key whatever you do (which is not trivial). If self-custody is important to you and you don't trust banks, a paper wallet - multiple backups, in multiple places, safely stored, ideally not recognizable as keys to a wallet - makes much more sense than a hardware wallet. If you have a hardware wallet lying around in your house it telegraphs to anyone finding it that you have it, and they might coerce access from you. Since you're not withdrawing anyway, you don't need the convenience they give of actually accessing the wallet. And if in the future, in many years, you REALLY want to withdraw, then you can still import it into a hardware wallet.\n\nPoint 2, to me, is the only one where a hardware wallet could conceivably make sense. But for that case, the non-long-term part of your holdings, which you hold for months or a couple years, just choosing the convenience of an ETF seems so much better in any way. You don't have the responsibility to secure them (that's your broker's responsibility), you don't have any risk of losing it, and you can sell anytime, if you need the money. If you don't trust banks, you can split your holdings in the long-term part (see Point 1), and just hold parts of it in an ETF, which also diversifies the ways you might lose access to your assets (if the bank blocks you from it, you still have the fallback of the self-custodial part, and if you happen to lose all your backups, you can always recover your broker...).\n\nIf self-custody is not important to you, ETFs are the way to go for both points 1 and 2, anyway.\n\nLong story short, my question: do you have any tangible use cases where a hardware wallet would be necessary or beneficial (in contrast to a paper wallet, which does make sense in some cases)?\n\nI don't see any sense in the product category...",

This drop looks more like a correction than a trend reversal similar to the ones we saw before major breakouts in previous cycles.\n\nStrong on-chain accumulation:\nOn-chain data shows long-term holders and institutions are still accumulating during this dip. When smart money buys fear, it\u2019s usually a sign the bottom is close.\n\nFunding rates resetting:\nFunding turned neutral to slightly negative across major exchanges meaning leveraged longs have cooled off. That often clears the path for a more sustainable rally.\n\nMacro factors improving:\nThe dollar index (DXY) has started to weaken again, and with central banks hinting at policy easing in 2025, liquidity could return to risk assets  including Bitcoin.\n\nThis dip might not be the end it could be the reset before BTC makes its next big move up. Keep an eye on volume and the $68K\u2013$70K range for confirmation.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your take  are we setting up for a bounce, or is there more pain ahead first?",

            "selftext": "As everyone knows zcash has been on a tear recently. I\u2019m kicking myself because I came to the conclusion last year that proof of work coins are the essentially the only crypto that will stand the test of time. I bought LTC, BCH, BTC, DOGE. The only proof of work coin I avoided that was available on major exchanges was zcash. Oh well, can\u2019t reverse the clocks. \n\nMoving forward, I think this zcash pump will bring attention to what\u2019s truly important in crypto - solid money. \n\nIn order to be solid money, privacy is a big factor. Zcash does a very good job at thia with zero knowledge proofs. The only other proof of work coin that achieves this is Litecoin with its recent MWEB layer. \n\nCurious, do you guys think that Litecoin will have long term success due to these factors? It checks all the same boxes as zcash but has more hashpower, an active leader in Charlie Lee and much more usage. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts about any other proof of work privacy coins. ",

So, if something happens to that custodian or to the BSC network, does that mean I could lose everything?\n\nWould it be safer to move my funds to the Bitcoin mainnet (native BTC), even if the fees are higher?\nWould love to hear what you guys think or if anyone here has experienced issues with wrapped BTC on other chains.\n\nThanks!",

No tokens required, no intermediaries, just web-native and per-request commerce. \n\nIt kind of feels like Venmo for APIs, only baked right into HTTP. \n\nIf it takes off, it could finally make the internet\u2019s micropayment dream real.  ESPECIALLY as AI agents/swarms are going to start transacting with each other.\n\nMy thoughts are that a feeless L1 payment rail is going to emerge as a HUGE beneficial use case.\n",

            "selftext": "Been pretty cynical about crypto adoption stuff after watching 2021 happen. Every company adding blockchain to their pitch deck... most of it was garbage and died off.\n\nEducation credentials are genuinely broken though. People fake transcripts constantly, degree mills everywhere, job applications are just PDFs anyone could photoshop. Verification system still runs on fax machines somehow. It's absurd when you think about it.\n\nFound this company Classover ticker KIDZ doing AI tutoring. They're holding SOL in treasury and running validators, using the yield to subsidize costs. First reaction was oh here we go another company trying to ride AI and crypto hype at the same time.\n\nBut they're putting student learning records on chain. Every lesson, quiz, whatever gets logged into this Learning Genome thing they built. Trained on 300k hours of actual teacher data not just ChatGPT with a education skin. The records become portable proof you own instead of locked in some school database that might disappear.\n\nSounds good on paper but does anyone actually care right now? Parents picking tutors want results not blockchain infrastructure. Universities still want official transcripts. Employers already don't trust LinkedIn why would they trust crypto credentials.\n\nWe've been waiting years for crypto to do something useful and now that something shows up nobody's gonna care because it's not a memecoin doing 100x in a week.\n\nThen again we said nobody needs peer to peer money either. Maybe this is early not wrong.\n\nTheir numbers look real at least. User growth, revenue growth, actual teachers on platform according to filings. So the tutoring part works regardless. Question is whether blockchain adds anything or just makes everything more complicated for no reason.\n\nPart of me thinks verifiable education records actually solve something. Part of me thinks I'm just desperate to find a crypto use case that isn't pure speculation after all these years. Can't tell if this makes sense or if I'm on hopium.\n\nThe company seems legitimate, problem definitely exists, but I've been wrong about \"real adoption\" before so who knows.",

Not for beginners or panic sellers. Always dyor !!!\n\nFull guide: [https://blog.retire-on-bitcoin.com/en/](https://blog.retire-on-bitcoin.com/en/)\n\nThoughts? Anyone running this strategy?

            "selftext": "I believe the Halloween feeling around Bitcoin has passed, but the weight of it still lingers in the market. That same quiet after a long night, where everyone starts looking around to see what really changed.\n\nIt went through a rough few days, and the talk around Cathie Wood\u2019s revised forecast, ETF outflows, and another round of regulatory headlines only made it heavier. Seeing how the market has been reacting more to mood than to data lately. I can sense how easily sentiment flips between confidence and doubt depending on who\u2019s moving money in or out.\n\nThe news about Samourai Wallet brought back an old conversation too, about how much freedom still exists around Bitcoin\u2019s original idea. It reminded me that this space isn\u2019t just about charts or inflows, it\u2019s about how much people still trust the system underneath. Some are trading it, others are defending it, and somewhere in between, the real narrative keeps forming.\n\nDespite the dip, some are still trading for the Halloween party, hoping to collect pumpkin puzzles and still getting set for other events, some even using getAgent to decide which direction to go. this shows how deep this space runs, how culture and curiosity keep traders active even when the market feels uncertain.\n\nAnd i think maybe that\u2019s why the Halloween timing feels symbolic every year. It\u2019s the reminder that Bitcoin was born in disguise, in a time when nobody expected it to survive. And yet, here it still is, tested again and again, in a world that keeps trying to control it.\n\nThe market feels cautious now, maybe even tired, but that\u2019s part of it. After every phase of noise and reaction, it always seems to have this quiet stretch where conviction gets tested. And i think that\u2019s usually when people start to see what really lasts.",

What now?\nOf course, I told my mom that if she regrets it or if she needs the money, i will give it back to her, no questions asked.\nI will keep working in my job as if nothing happened, I will tell no one, not even my fiance\u00e9 (we will get married by separated assets), if I go unemployed I will do everything to get a job asap so I won't be taking a single satoshi out of it.\nBut my question is, I have no idea on how to plan a proper retirement or Bitcoin cash-out plan, or how long should I hold? Should I open a bank account in Dubai so i can cash it out free of taxes? I want to eventually tell to my soon-to-be-wife but I just don't know how, I feel like I'm sitting on a lottery ticket that increases exponentially over time.\n\nI pay my taxes, sure, but i just don't want to pay a stupid amount like 35-40% just to enjoy my money.\nI also don't trust any legal or financial advisor, also I live in a Latinamerican country, and even a full Bitcoin at today's price it's already a life changing amount of money, and saying to anyone that I own a full Bitcoin could potentially make me a target.\n\nPlease, I feel lost about all of this, any advice or experience will be helpful, thanks a lot in advance!\n\n(Sorry for broken English, not my native language)",

            "selftext": "Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 networks reached a new record this week \u2014 a 24-hour peak of about 19,000 transactions per second, with the daily average under 10,000 TPS, according to GrowThePie\u2019s \u201cEthereum Ecosystem TPS\u201d dashboard. Most of the activity came from Lighter, a zero-knowledge perpetuals exchange that recently launched its mainnet.\n\nLighter processed several thousand TPS on its own, temporarily accounting for the majority of Ethereum\u2019s overall transaction throughput. It uses ZK proofs to batch and verify trades on Ethereum mainnet, relying on the blob data system introduced by the Dencun upgrade (EIP-4844) earlier this year. Blobs significantly reduced the cost of posting compressed L2 data to Ethereum, allowing higher throughput without increasing mainnet load.\n\nOther major L2s \u2014 Base, Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, and Soneium \u2014 contributed smaller but steady portions to the total. The combined activity illustrates how Ethereum\u2019s scalability now depends less on single-chain capacity and more on the aggregate throughput of its rollups.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is central to this shift. By moving large data payloads into blob space, rollups can cheaply record transaction data while still settling on Ethereum\u2019s security layer. The result is a modular system where computation happens off-chain, but finality and verification remain on-chain. The current throughput numbers show that this structure is functioning as intended.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear that the increase came from an application-specific rollup, not from general-purpose usage. Lighter\u2019s focus on high-frequency perpetual trading naturally produces large volumes of small transactions, which are efficient to batch and verify. The performance gain shows what is possible when a specialized L2 design is matched to a specific workload.\n\nEthereum\u2019s base layer remains the coordination and settlement layer for these rollups. The fact that the system can sustain this level of throughput without a network-wide stress event indicates that the scaling path through blobs and rollups is working.\n\nThe next step will be to see whether similar gains appear across other L2s running different workloads \u2014 payments, gaming, and general-purpose smart contracts \u2014 and whether throughput can grow without centralizing sequencers or compromising verification.\n\nFor now, the data shows a clear trend: Ethereum\u2019s scaling is no longer theoretical. The rollups are live, the blobs are being used, and the throughput is measurable.",

            "selftext": "So we woke up to another bloodbath today. The crypto market lost around 66 billion in value overnight with Bitcoin dipping back toward 100k and most altcoins getting absolutely wrecked.\n\nBitcoin dropped about 2% and is sitting just above that psychological 100k level again. Ethereum was weaker, hovering in the mid-$3,000s. But honestly the real carnage was in altcoins where basically everything is deep red.\n\nThere\u2019s been some standouts tho. A few smaller tokens actually pumped hard while everything else was tanking. Momentum (MOM) surged around 240%, and some AI-related projects saw decent gains. But for every winner there\u2019s like 50 losers right now.\n\nThe Fear and Greed Index has completely collapsed. It was around 58 a month ago and now it\u2019s in the high-20s, which puts us deep in fear territory. That\u2019s one of the lowest ranges since early 2024 so sentiment is genuinely terrible.\n\nWhat\u2019s causing this? Multiple things honestly. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw about $578M in net outflows yesterday, with Fidelity alone around $357M, which is heavy institutional selling pressure.\n\nFed Chair Powell basically said a December rate cut isn\u2019t guaranteed, which spooked everyone. Higher rates for longer means people pull money out of risky assets like crypto. Plus the dollar keeps getting stronger, which historically weighs on crypto prices.\n\nLiquidations have been brutal too. Over $2B in positions got liquidated in 24 hours, mostly people betting on prices going up. When leverage unwinds like this it creates a cascading effect that amplifies the selloff.\u2026 if you\u2019re reshuffling positions in this chop, tag buys vs transfers and lot ids as you go\u2026 i keep it tidy in Awaken tax so the reporting doesn\u2019t turn into detective work later.\n\nThe question now is whether this is just healthy deleveraging before the next leg up or the start of something worse.",

These parties will be able to claim USDC.  \n  \nAs a part of this, the mint/redeem infrastructure has been turned off, and we will be sunsetting deUSD in the near future. Any affected LPs in AMM pools or lending markets will be able to claim the full value of their position.  \n  \nGiven that Stream comprised of 99%+ of the lending positions (and has decided to not repay or close positions), we will work with Euler, Morpho, Compound and the curators moving forward to help distribute repayment of the Stream loan to liquidate these positions. We still believe this will be honored 1 for 1.  \n  \nWe will follow up to this post later today with claim page information.\n\nSource: [https://x.com/elixir/status/1986443495351927257](https://x.com/elixir/status/1986443495351927257)",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,  \n\nI hope this post will be informative for others. I\u2019m still learning about Bitcoin and its ecosystem, so I may lack some basic knowledge.  \n\nNote: I won\u2019t respond to any DMs, no matter the reason\u2014so please don\u2019t try.  \n\nImportant information : I won't use a commercial device like Trezor or Ledger, I don't want any company to potentially know my seed phrase or risk leaking it due to a mistake.   \n\nI plan to use two addresses:  \n- Hot wallet for casual transactions.  \n- Cold wallet as my \"safe.\"  \nBoth will use Standard SegWit for now, but I might switch to a multi-sig setup for the cold wallet later.  \n\nQuestion 1 : Security Risks When Sending Bitcoin.  \nCurrently, when I want to send Bitcoin, I:  \n- Connect to the internet.  \n- Open Electrum.  \n- Enter my seed phrase and complete the transaction.  \nThis expose me to potential attacks via the internet. What precautions should I take, or is there a safer alternative?  \n\nQuestion 2 : Checking My Hot Wallet Balance Without Exposing My Seed Phrase.  \nTo avoid entering my seed phrase every time I check my balance for my Hot wallet, I\u2019ve stored my master public key on a cloud service I chose (which I consider reliable). I then use Bitref to check my balance.  \n\nPreviously, I used Electrum on my phone, but I realized that keeping the master public key on my phone in the application could expose it to attacks anytime. Now, I only expose it when checking my balance.  \nDoes this approach make sense, or are there better ways to monitor my balance securely?   \n\nLooking forward to your thoughts and advice!",

The economy is ass, and people need to eat. As AI continues to accelerate, more and more people will be laid off. There will be more layoffs than there are new jobs in the next 2-3 years. Money are going to be tight, and people are going to start selling their assets due to rising cost in everything. I would not be surprise if the entire market continue to eat shit and this will wipe out a lot of different type of assets--not just crypto. ",

What started as a simple idea quickly became a full-time mission: buy the vehicle, brand it, educate passengers, and prove BCH works for everyday payments.\n\nThe response from the public has been surprising \u2014 everywhere the branded car goes, people ask what BCH is, how it works, and why they should use it. The vehicle has turned into a mobile Bitcoin Cash seminar, onboarding new users daily. Passengers pay less when using BCH, payments are instant, and the experience helps people understand crypto beyond speculation.\n\nThere\u2019s still a long road ahead. My goal is to get BCH accepted by at least five local merchants and expand adoption between Maputo and Matola. Some are already enthusiastic, while others need more education \u2014 but every conversation brings us closer.\n\nThe mission continues, and BCH is winning on the ground here in Mozambique. This project proves one thing clearly: Bitcoin Cash works in the real world \u2014 fast, cheap, and empowering for everyday people.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello r/CryptoCurrency,\n\nWe are contributors from the BONK ( r/BONKfunOfficial ) ecosystem and team members involved with BONKfun and the BONK Digital Asset Treasury (Bonk Inc., ticker BNKK). We are here to discuss BONK\u2019s ecosystem growth, the launchpad model, and how the treasury operates.\n\n# About BONK\n\nBONK is a community-driven token on Solana focused on building products that generate real activity and direct value toward the token. The BONK ecosystem includes BONKfun, BONK Bot, BONK Swap, an NFT marketplace, and consumer-facing applications that bring new users to Solana. BONK currently has more than 400 integrations, operates on 13 chains, and is approaching one million onchain holders.\n\n# About BONKfun\n\nBONK . fun is a launchpad for meme tokens built around transparent economics. It allows anyone to create a token in minutes, with fees distributed to support the BONK ecosystem. Half of all platform fees are used to buy and burn BONK, 8 percent are used for BONK accumulation, and the remainder fund operations and development. Public dashboards track activity, fees, and burns in real time. The platform has become the largest launchpad on Solana, accounting for more than half of all new token launches in mid-2025.\n\n# About the BONK Digital Asset Treasury (BNKK)\n\nBonk Inc. (Nasdaq: BNKK) is the public-markets digital asset treasury dedicated to BONK accumulation. It receives a 10 percent revenue share from BONKfun and reinvests about 90 percent of that income into open-market BONK purchases. The company currently holds about 2.75 percent of BONK\u2019s circulating supply and has stated a target of 5 percent by the end of 2025. The treasury is actively managed through partnerships with institutional asset managers to generate non-dilutive yield and preserve capital.\n\nThis structure connects ecosystem activity with public-company participation. Revenue from BONKfun creates recurring buy pressure, while the treasury establishes a corporate vehicle aligned with BONK\u2019s long-term growth.\n\n# Topics we can discuss during the AMA\n\n* How BONKfun works and what differentiates it from other launchpads\n* The structure of BONK\u2019s burn and buyback system\n* The design and purpose of the BONK Digital Asset Treasury\n* How revenue from BONKfun and other applications flows into BONK accumulation\n* The broader BONK ecosystem and integrations on Solana and other chains\n* The significance of approaching one million holders and the planned one-percent supply burn\n* The role of Bonk Inc. in bridging onchain activity with traditional finance\n\nWe will be answering questions from this thread during the AMA window.\n\nThank you for having us, and we look forward to your questions.\n\n\u2014 The BONK Team",

Other than that, I\u2019m personally done with the cryptocurrency casino.\n\nMy opinion, if you care to know about how the number one cryptocurrency goes below $50,000 is mostly the state of the world economy, because I believe 2026 will be a lot like 2022, especially if or when the AI (artificial intelligence) bubble pops. \n\nAlso, the game that you know who is playing with his so called \u201cstrategy\u201d\u2026 I think that whole thing will blow up once the number one coin tanks enough, and it\u2019ll take down the other copycats as well in the process\u2026 this is all just one man\u2019s opinion though of course.\n\nWhat do you think, have the mega-gain cryptocurrency cycles of yesteryear come to an end, or do we pump to Jupiter before the year is out?",

            "selftext": "The current setup in the crypto market looks tense but to some people think its full of opportunity, Many traders are anticipating a potential 8\u201310% correction, which if it plays out could trigger short term pain across both Bitcoin and altcoins. Historically, such pullbacks during strong uptrends have served as liquidity resets before major moves.  \n  \nRight now, I\u2019m still watching the $92,000 level for Bitcoin, which remains a key zone that could be retested if momentum fades, That level has acted as both support and resistance in previous cycles, making it critical for assessing whether the current rally is sustainable or overextended.  \n  \nInterestingly, Coinbase has been showing signs of active bidding today, suggesting renewed institutional and retail interest despite the cautious sentiment, These bids could be an early indicator of accumulation before the next volatility burst.  \n  \nWith the US market opening, equity performance especially in tech heavy indices may play a big role in how BTC moves today, If Coinbase continues to show buy pressure into the open, we could see Bitcoin attempt to break through the $105,000 resistance zone, which has capped multiple rallies this week.  \n  \nOverall, today\u2019s price action will reveal a lot about whether Bitcoin still has strength to push higher or if a healthy correction is on the horizon, Either way, it\u2019s a crucial day for traders watching how crypto reacts to macro flows and exchange activity.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been in the crypto world for many years. I have multiple wallets, cold storage, YubiKeys, everything. I thought I was too experienced to fall for a scam. But I still did. I fell for the classic promise of making money fast and easy through \u201carbitrage\u201d.\n\nA few days ago, I transferred part of my funds to what I should have realized was a fake exchange. It had been created only a few days earlier, and it was full of red flags that I ignored.\n\n\n\n# How it happened\n\nAbout a year ago, I joined a Telegram channel that shared crypto news. The person behind it seemed legitimate. He had a YouTube channel, an Instagram account, showed his face in every video, and spoke with confidence.\n\nAt first, it was only market news and updates. Then came trading signals, and they were actually good. After some time, as the market became more volatile, he started sharing so-called \u201carbitrage opportunities\u201d.\n\nI joined a few of them, and everything worked. The deposits, the trades, the withdrawals, all fine. Until the last one. That was the scam.\n\nHe said he had found an exchange with a large price spread and encouraged everyone to take advantage quickly. I created an account, made a small test transfer, and it worked. I could enter and withdraw without any issue. The second time, when I sent more funds, I never got them back.\n\nI\u2019m not going to share too many details here, because Reddit tends to remove posts that include names or links. My goal is not revenge. My goal is to make sure this reaches as many people as possible.\n\n\n\n# What I discovered after\n\nAfter feeling absolutely terrible for a few days, I started investigating. I found out that this wasn\u2019t just one guy. It\u2019s a whole network, mostly Russian-speaking, using the same strategy.\n\nThey build Telegram communities, sometimes pretending to be men, sometimes women. They show their faces, act like normal people, post on Instagram and YouTube, and create trust over time. When they feel the group is ready, they launch the fake \u201carbitrage\u201d opportunity and drain everyone\u2019s funds.\n\nI know some people will comment \u201chow could anyone fall for that?\u201d. But that\u2019s not the point. The point is that these scams are evolving. They are more social, more human, and much harder to detect because they rely on trust, not just fake websites.\n\n\n\n# Why I\u2019m posting this\n\nI\u2019m sharing my story to help others identify the same pattern. If anyone has experienced something similar, please comment below so we can connect the dots.\n\nPlease **do not message me privately** unless you\u2019ve commented here first. Reddit is full of scammers, and I want to keep this open and transparent.\n\nStay safe out there. No matter how experienced you think you are, these scams can still get you when you\u2019re tired, emotional, or desperate.",

Now we\u2019re seeing progress both from traditional players and from crypto-native projects building usable payment systems.\n\nPlatforms like xMoney are part of that shift, connecting digital assets and everyday transactions through global payment rails. The goal isn\u2019t speculation anymore, it\u2019s making crypto practical for merchants and users worldwide.\n\nSo what do you think, will this new wave of blockchain payments finally make crypto part of everyday finance, or will it stay behind the scenes powering traditional systems?\n\nCrypto is quietly moving beyond charts and exchanges, turning into real infrastructure that can power how money moves in the digital age.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been following the crypto space for about three years now, but I just turned 18 this year, so I could only recently set up my own wallet. That means I don\u2019t have any real exposure to crypto yet.\n\nNow I\u2019m planning to start investing, mainly in Bitcoin, but I\u2019m wondering what the smarter approach would be:\nShould I start a simple DCA (dollar-cost averaging) plan right away, or would it make more sense to save up some money first and then enter in several tranches depending on market conditions?\n\nCurious to hear how you guys would approach it as a beginner starting fresh in 2025.",

This hot wallet is strictly for quick transfer and aggregation of funds coming out of different centralized exchanges (CEXs) before sending to my cold storage or to another exchange for a specific trade. I need to be able to receive obscure tokens as they come off exchanges.\n\nI'd love to hear about any wallets that:\n\n    Meet the open-source and multi-currency criteria.\n\n    You trust for holding \"middleman\" funds securely.\n\nThank you for your valuable suggestions!",

            "selftext": "Gold due to being difficult to subdivide for daily use and transport quickly over long distances led people to trade it in to banks for IOUs which could more easily be transported long distances and subdivided. Every time though banks issued more IOUs than they had Gold which led to inflation and a collapse of the system.\n\nBitcoin currently does NOT scale. It does around 170M transactions per year. Even if everyone did nothing except buy BTC and do nothing else with it, it would take humanity 47 years to onboard. Even if everyone exclusively used L2 for transactions, you still need to onboard to L1 and open a channel to get onto L2 in the first place.\n\nPeople are then saying it's ok because you can just have large L2 node providers give you an IOU that represents BTC on L2, but if that's the case then WHAT WAS THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF THIS!? There's nothing that prevents node providers from issuing more IOUs than they have BTC and then we are just back to trusting banks not to issue more claims than they have hard asset backing it. Something all banks and governments have proven themselves completely incapable of doing throughout all of history.\n\nIt's basically just Gold backed paper with extra steps.\n\nSomeone please tell me we have some solutions/proposals for this problem to prevent history from just repeating itself. I need to feel like we can break out of this broken money hell loop.",

            "selftext": "Bitcoin dropped below 100k earlier this week and everyones either panicking or waiting on the sidelines. But Matt Hougan from Bitwise has a pretty interesting take that might change how you see this sideways action.\n\nHe's comparing whats happening now to when Facebook went public back in 2012. Facebook IPO\u2019d at $38, then spent about a year below that level before eventually climbing to $600+ in later years. During that time the fundamentals werent getting worse it was just distribution happening. Early employees were cashing out their life changing wealth while institutions slowly absorbed all that supply.\n\nHougan says Bitcoin is in the exact same phase right now. People who bought at 1 dollar or 10 dollars or 100 dollars are finally selling into deep institutional demand. Five years ago someone selling a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin might have hit price harder. Today large sales seem to get absorbed more easily because of the ETFs, funds, and some corporates buying.\n\nThis sideways chop isnt weakness according to him its actually what maturity looks like. Once these early holders finish distributing the only thing stopping Bitcoin from going from roughly the low trillions toward an order of magnitude higher market cap is broader global acceptance.\n\nHis big point is that 1% allocations to Bitcoin are over. He thinks 5% should be the new minimum for investors because Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is lower than in early cycles but still real and it\u2019s becoming a more established institutional asset now. small practical note\u2026 if you are accumulating through this chop, keep clean records so future disposals are easy\u2026 i tag buys vs transfers and lot IDs in Awaken tax so tax time doesnt turn into a mess later.\n\nSo is this the moment to buy more? If you believe in the IPO comparison then yes this distribution phase is exactly when you want to be accumulating before institutions finish absorbing the supply. But obviously thats a big if and nobody knows for sure.",

This exact setup has never happened before for Bitcoin.\n\n1. T10Y2Y up from Deep Inversion (aka Yield Curve Re-Steepening)\n   * The difference between 10-year and 2-year U.S. Treasury yields. When negative (inverted), it signals recession fear and tight money. When it rises from its low (re-steepens), it means markets expect rate cuts and easier conditions.\n   * Now: From \u2013106 bps in June 2023 to + 50bps today uninverted and stable.\n   * Bullish: Lower short-term rates = cheaper borrowing -> more capital for risk assets like Bitcoin.\n2. WALCL Stops Shrinking, Flat for now (Fed Balance Sheet Pivot)\n   * The Fed\u2019s total assets (WALCL on FRED). During QT, it falls, draining money from markets. When it flattens or grows, liquidity returns.\n   * Now: QT ends December 1, 2025, $95B/month reinvested into T-bills.\n   * Bullish: More bank reserves = more lending = more money chasing Bitcoin and stocks.\n3. DXY down (U.S. Dollar Weakening)\n   * The U.S. Dollar Index. A falling DXY means global investors are moving out of cash into risk assets.\n   * Now: From 109 in Feb 2025 to \\~ 100 today, 9% drop in 9 months.\n   * Weak dollar = strong Bitcoin, gold, stocks, and crypto.\n\nThe market is volatile, so dca, long term will win. Remember, is the time in the market, not timing the market.\n\nBTC at 102k corresponding to risk 42 over 100, i will dca in if the risk still below 50 this sunday.\n\n",

I\u2019m from a country where my wage is around 800\u20ac a month and from this wage I managed to stack above 1 mil sats and i started to learn a lot about it. I believe there\u2019s something special about this virtual coin and I don\u2019t know why but every damn time I buy no matter the price I feel more safe in my heart that I\u2019m doing the right thing for my future self. Not because the price could go to the moon but because I really believe that this coin will be the future of money. Bitcoin made me believe that I can escape this fiat system before it kills my dreams and I will not need to work for somebody till I die. That\u2019s just my thoughts, thanks a lot for reading everybody \ud83e\udef6",

            "selftext": "No matter the price action always related to crypto external events or economics, Ethereum keeps building and evolving and it is on the verge of something massive. Right now, Ethereum Layer 2 networks are really booming. Daily transactions across L2s have surpassed Ethereum mainnet multiple times over and the growth is not slowing down. What is coming next is more exciting, Ethereum L1 itself is about to scale in ways that sounded impossible just a few years ago.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum processes 18.6 transactions per second (TPS) which is not bad for a decentralized network that prioritizes security and neutrality. But by 2031, projections suggest it could surpass 10,000 TPS. That is a 500x increase in capacity without sacrificing decentralization or trust lessness.\n\nThis will happen because of the combination of multiple upgrades like Danksharding, Data Availability Sampling (DAS) and Execution Parallelization. All of them together will transform Ethereum into a high throughput trust layer for the global onchain economy, in other words, the base layer that all other blockchains, rollups and dApps can rely on.\n\nThe Ethereum is too slow and expensive narrative is aging out fast and we are entering a new era where Ethereum is not just the settlement layer for crypto, it becomes the foundation for the entire digital economy.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet:\u00a0[https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985917494951862463](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985917494951862463)",

            "title": "BONK's Digital Asset Treasury",
            "selftext": "The rise of Digital Asset Treasuries has become a central theme in crypto. Public companies and onchain organizations are increasingly holding tokens as long-term assets. To date, most treasuries have focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Litecoin. These assets offer stability and liquidity, but their size limits how much impact new accumulation can have.\n\nBONK occupies a different position. With a market capitalization of about $1 billion dollars, it sits in the mid-cap range, supported by an expanding ecosystem and a growing treasury. We believe this combination of scale and structure gives BONK a higher potential for compounding growth than the larger, slower-moving assets dominating current treasuries.\n\nThe BONK Digital Asset Treasury is operated through Bonk Inc. (BNKK). The company currently holds about 2.75% of the circulating supply and aims to reach 5% by the end of 2025. It earns a 10% revenue share from BONKfun and allocates roughly 90 percent of that income to open-market BONK purchases. This model transforms ecosystem activity into continuous, recurring accumulation.\n\nEach percentage of supply added to the treasury represents tens of millions of dollars in new demand. Because BONK\u2019s market cap is smaller than traditional treasury assets, this level of accumulation has a more visible effect on overall market depth and pricing.\n\nBONK\u2019s ecosystem is one of the most comprehensive among meme coins. It spans more than 400 integrations and operates on 13 chains. Core components include BONKfun, BONK Bot, BONK Swap, and an NFT marketplace, along with partnerships in sports, fitness, and entertainment. These products anchor BONK\u2019s position within Solana while expanding its utility beyond trading.\n\nThe community is also approaching one million onchain holders. When that threshold is reached, a 1% supply burn will take place. Combined with ongoing burns from ecosystem products, this structure reinforces BONK\u2019s deflationary design and long-term alignment with active users.\n\nWhat separates BONK from other digital asset treasuries is its leverage to growth. Large-cap assets require massive inflows to move the market, while BONK\u2019s scale allows smaller amounts of new demand to create measurable change. It maintains liquidity across Solana and additional chains, offering accessibility while retaining room for appreciation.\n\nMost existing treasuries simply hold their assets. BONK\u2019s approach creates a feedback loop in which product success funds further accumulation. It connects platform revenue, community activity, and corporate structure under one framework that compounds over time.\n\nBONK combines the community energy of a meme token with the operational discipline of a public treasury. It is verifiable, active, and built on a foundation of measurable economic inputs rather than speculation.\n\nIn the broader context of digital asset treasuries, BONK illustrates how smaller-cap assets can use real revenue and structured accumulation to drive value. It represents a faster, more reflexive model with the potential for greater upside as the ecosystem and treasury continue to expand.",
