A -> P is impossible and P -> S is also impossible.\n\nNow my HD wallet which is a watch-only wallet obviously does not know S, because it is a watch-only wallet that does not have the private key. But yet it can still generate the same addresses as my normal wallet, that has the private key and therefore knows S.\n\nIf someone understand things better than I do and would explain, I'd appreciate",

            "selftext": "All this debate on when and how coins will upgrade to be protected from Quantum risk- and what impacts it will cause- are good conversations because it is important chains start their transition plans.  It will be healthy for the space to overcome this concern.  \n  \nBut it isn't where the value is.    \n  \nWhile there may be some challenges and some failures, it likely is not going to cause people to jump into new coins purely because they are worried about security.\n\nThe common belief is either top coins will easily upgrade with no fallout, or that we hardly should worry because we'll have \"bigger\" problems elsewhere.    \n  \nLet's assume that's true.\n\nThen it makes a couple things crystal clear.  All systems have to get this upgrade work done.  And most systems are going to leverage solutions rather than start from scratch.\n\nNIST has approved algorithms. So, businesses can take on the challenge of trying to just cutover to these and hope their staff can figure it out.  But it's not simple work.  And will be disruptive and risky.  \n  \nEnabling smooth transitions is what people are going to want.   \n  \nI had been following Qanplatform all these years seeing opportunity with multi-language smart contracts. I was never quite sure if quantum advancements would take hold or create adoption for prepared projects.\n\nNow it seems the the quantum risk narrative is gaining strength.  But not in the fashion we thought.    \n  \nThe work Qanplatform has done to offer solutions outside of crypto creates utility for a completely new untapped market.  They are powering Signquantum which is being implemented by Ueno bank.  That's a gigantic first step into the space.  It sets them up for both growth and high visibility.\n\nThere will be other solutions, and of course not all systems have a use for recording on an immutable ledger.  But a whole do want to add that layer of security, and that's a large market for a small project.  Keep an eye out for opportunities like this.  There will be several trying to make a name in this space.  \n",

            "selftext": "In hindsight, it might have looked like the easiest and most fun short run.\n\nBut it wasn't all fun and games.\n\nI initially thought about shorting when BTC broke below $108k. But I thought the market didn't have enough catalysts for that big of a fall, and the longer term trend was too bullish.\n\nIt's when it finally broke below $100K that I saw that the panic had snowballed, and there was no need to look for any rationale anymore, the market was in emotional mode.\n\nI opened the first short position just below $99K (PERP).\n\nBut it was still a scary ride in the first hours:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4s0xkixpm2g1.jpg?width=837&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74226cd3b34a8f1c2d2849a4289666102941ef0a\n\nAt $94K I felt pretty confident again about the snowballing and opened another one.\n\nThat's when things got really scary:\n\n[Second short position](https://preview.redd.it/ysznt6fynm2g1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=1052cd65c039ad82f4ce2603fbf2981d99481aef)\n\nThat's when I thought for a moment \"what was I thinking shorting!\". I could smell the liquidation.\n\nThen all these things ran through my mind:\n\n\\-Did I jump in way too late.\n\n\\-Things don't just go straight down endlessly.\n\n\\-It wasn't gonna be that easy to short.\n\n\\-It's a less volatile cycle, we're not gonna get 40-55% straight dips like in the past. Maybe not even over 35%.\n\n\\-This all started because of the China tariffs, but they got scaled back now.\n\n\\-The shutdown added fuel, and that fuel is gone.\n\n\\-Fed rate cuts will eventually happen, QE might be in the upcoming months, M2 and global liquidity are going up. Maybe people are realizing that those things aren't that far anymore.\n\nSo I closed a portion of my position.\n\nI still had faith that there was still a lot of momentum and remembered \"don't fight the trend\".\n\nRetail is probably still gonna panic. They don't turn their emotions off that quickly.\n\nI let the rest ride in all the way to $85K.\n\nMy original goal was to stay until at least $84K, but it got too scary.\n\nI made some decent money, but never made it all the way to 10%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjiwvrl6sm2g1.jpg?width=854&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0be7512287b6a5dd78a4c1c6ab402e7ffcdc3872\n\nOf course I got out too soon, but I think it was getting too risky. I'm happy I made it that far.\n\nIt's a big ask to ask for still a lot more dip after what happened.\n\nI feel like I got in a little too late, and got lucky to get that far from where I entered.\n\nEven if we are entering a bear cycle and there's no new ATH, I think there will still be rallies and mini bull runs, and probably at least one last test of $100K. But we'd have to go below $74K before the first real confirmation that we are in a bear market.",

As soon as you realize that the value of one bitcoin cannot just keep on increasing at a constant rate without pullback, then you will be ok. If you look at the graph, the value of bitcoin hit an ath of around $69k, but then just a few short months later it dropped to a staggering $15k! Where the real test came into play was those who were being able to HODL bitcoin during those tough times that showed people's investments in the red/negative, because it literally looks like they lost all of their money. But the winners have ALWAYS been those who were willing to hold and fight through the treacherous two years, because wel all know what happened to the value of bitcoin after that. In 2025, the value skyrocketed to over $126k, and then it created this sense of excitement and hype, so when the price starts to decline, it makes people feared for there life. This is the same thing that happened in the end of 2022! Those who feared sold, but those who held are winning. There are chances that bitcoin might drop as low as $50k, but we all know what happens after that. That will be your chance to buy, whether if it's bitcoin or another crypto. You all need to learn to keep your fingers on the **BUY** button instead of the **SELL** button. Bitcoin is the parent cryptocurrency and feeds all of the others. You should use this same philosophy when it comes to any other legit coin that you may or may not own, which I will not name. \n\n  \nSo, just ride the wave.",

Since inception Bitcoin has seen massive pumps and massive dumps - we all have access to the charts and we all knew what we signed up for when we hit the 'buy' button.  This asset is not for the weak and it's not for the risk-adverse.\n\nIf any retail investors are freaking out right now it's because A.) they did not understand what they were buying, B.) they are overexposed and went in heavier than they should have, or C.) both.  This is an asset that can pump or dump 25% within 1 week based on a single Tweet.  If you're freaking out right now, JUST BREATHE.  These are only paper loses until you click 'sell'.  If you're overexposed and afraid you're going to lose your shirt if this goes to $0 I understand your panic - but then you shouldn't have bought Bitcoin in the first place.  Sorry not sorry.\n\nHindsight is 20/20 and we all question our decisions - after all we're only human.  \"Should have sold\", \"should have bought\", etc.  But people, two words ... ZOOM OUT.  Just two years ago we would have seen $80k as an unattainable high.  Now we see it as the death of Bitcoin.  Really??\n\nI'm also tired of people asking \"well what should I do?\"  Only YOU can answer that question.  Yeah, the person 2 years away from retirement with 70% of their portfolio in Bitcoin right now should probably get out unless they're okay with the possible reality of needing to push their retirement out to be able to live within their means.  But the 35 year old who is currently down 15% on their initial investment with no large purchases in the foreseeable future and plenty of diversification and liquidity elsewhere - WHY WOULD YOU SELL?  Come on people.\n\nOnly invest what you can afford to lose, DCA, stack sats, and HODL.\n\n",

So far I've had to dial back on my leverage to maintain a good equity ratio, but I haven't been liquidated and won't be as long as I continue maintaining my ratio (About 30% of my BTC portfolio was leverage, so I'm maintaining that ratio).\n Sure, I've taken some losses by removing some leverage, but I haven't touched my equity yet. Still in the game and HODLing \ud83d\udc4c\n\nSorry for slight vent, just basically wanted to say don't use leverage, it adds to the stress and anxiety you feel when BTC pulls back immensely lol",

Dad is acting like he invented crypto, bragging to his golf buddies ROTFL :D.\n\nThen\u2026 May 2021 happens. China FUD, Elon tweets, the whole circus. BTC dumps hard all the way to \\~30k (basically 1/3 of the top). I\u2019m sweating bullets, refreshing charts every 5 minutes, basically aged 10 years. My dad? **Zero panic.** He just keeps saying \u201cthis happened in 2017 too, relax kid.\u201d\n\nFast forward and of course he ends up looking like a genius when we blasted past 69k again.\n\nFast forward **to today.** I\u2019m the one refreshing charts every 5 mins like a zombie at 3am while we\u2019re bleeding from 109k\u219291k\u2192wherever the hell we close this week. I\u2019m legitimately nervous, ngl. Swearing and sweating a lot.\n\nThis morning my dad texts me out of nowhere:\n\n*\u201cRemember 2021? You were crying when it went from 69k to 30k. I wasn\u2019t.*  \n\n*Same movie, different year.*  \n\n*If this thing drops to 40k I\u2019m buying more with the grandkids\u2019 college fund \ud83d\ude02*  \n\n*See you at 250k+ kiddo.\u201d*\n\nI hate that he\u2019s probably right again. I hate it so much.\n\n**Thanks for always being the chill one, dad**. Guess the student has become the nervous wreck and the master stays based.\n\nAnyone else getting reverse orange-pilled by their boomer parents right now or just me? \ud83d\ude05\n\n\\#bitcoin #dad #chill #relax \n\n",

I was in with a little money and got lucky buying things at the very beginning like IOTA and TRON. I also got some NEO and Reddit was talking about lot about NANO (we can\u2019t be right all the time:). \n\nAt some point I had 2 BTC. That was incredible! I sold them. I felt so happy and a winner. Bought a brand new mini cooper, some furniture and save the rest of the money.  I thought \u201cit\u2019s over, this will crash\u201d. The crash really came and, again, I felt so smart. Reddit was in panic. The hot line was pinned, I felt so bad reading all the posts. \n\nCut to today: if I had that two BTC now I could just retire. Don\u2019t sell cheap. \n\nI\u2019m buying again. I hope I won\u2019t make the same mistake again. I\u2019m 55 now. My plan is to keep these BTC that I am buying safe for 10 years and then, just then, finally retire (I have more money, crypto is just part of the portfolio).\n\nIf I can take this risk, you can take too. Be responsible, don\u2019t put more than you can afford to lose. Just chill. \n\nRemember my history. It took me 10 years of freedom.",

More than free and decentralized money, that is what Bitcoin truly represents.\n\nRight now, we are suffering heavily. Some are selling, some are shorting, but I am standing my ground.\n\nWith that in mind, let me share something with you: I have never shorted a single thing in my life. It goes against my most important values as a person\u2014honor and integrity. I know that when I buy, I intend to sell at some point in the future, but at least I contribute to lifting the asset with my time and energy. I do not want to profit from other people\u2019s pain and suffering. To me, this is about more than profit\u2014it\u2019s about who we are. I will never short against your hopes and dreams.\n\nFinally, I know this may sound like a clich\u00e9, but I will stand my ground\u2014not only for my hopes and dreams, but for yours as well. More than money\u2014forget that\u2014these difficult situations test us for what we truly ARE.\n\nBest of luck to us all!",

            "selftext": "DAT's like MSTR, BMNR and others have been one of 2 big buyers that propelled this cycle.  \nThe DAT plan is simple, you need to be the biggest so that you get into the big indices and when you do, passive index trackers are forced to buy large amounts of your stock. As they do you get bigger and get added to more indices, and so the cycle perpetuates.\n\nOn EXACTLY 10th October, MSCI , the world's 2nd biggest Index company published that they are questioning whether companies that hold crypto assets as their core business, should be considered as \"companies\" or \"funds\".\n\nIf they are \"funds\" they are not included in passive indexing. why, because this creates a circular loop. The fund buys assets , gets bigger and then is included in more indices and buys more assets.\n\nThe expected ruling will be announced on 15 January 2026 and if this does pass, the companies like MSTR will be automatically removed from all indices. If this happens it would mean that all the pension funds, normal funds and all other passive index holders would dump their MSTR automatically. It would also mean that going forward they would never be included and as such , one of the big reasons why they actually exist would disappear.\n\nSince DATs have been powering this cycle and have been most the buying pressure, the smart money saw this immediately after the 10TH of October announcement and positioned accordingly. The 10TH of October wasn't a coincidence after all - It was smart money seeing a big risk to crypto and the current market structure.\n\nThe market will probably continue to dump until around the end of December and if the announcement is negative, we will get a huge dump in preparation for the removal from the indices. On the other hand , if it is positive , the bull market is back!!\n\nCredits go to Ran Neuner",

Until you actually lock something in, nothing\u2019s really happened.\n\nI work for a major crypto company, so maybe that puts me in my own little bubble, but I can say with certainty that everything internally is business as usual. Same as it was when people were losing their minds during the all-time highs.\n\nThis industry has lived through far worse. Liquidity is getting pulled from the whole system, not just crypto.\n\nJust like every run-up, this is sentiment. Right now more people feel unsure than confident, so we're seeing that uncertainty reflected in the market. No external factor means anything until people actually react to it, and at the moment the reaction is fear. That\u2019s all this is. When sentiment flips again, it\u2019ll swing just as quickly the other way.\n\nA lot of people haven\u2019t actually lived through a real crash. It\u2019s easy to acknowledge volatility, or look at past charts and say \u201ceverything recovered,\u201d but feeling it as it happens is completely different. Every red candle feels personal.\n\nI\u2019m lucky enough to have the funds to DCA, and I see this as an opportunity. Not saying you should do the same, but if you came in with a long time horizon and weren\u2019t here for a quick flip, nothing has changed. The fundamentals, the catalysts, and the institutional money are all still there... and will be there when the market recovers. \n\nWill you?\n\nYou can\u2019t control the market, but you can control how you respond to it. And sometimes, when everyone else is panicking, even just doing nothing is the smartest move.\n\nPeriods like this have always been followed by stronger recoveries, and the foundation now is far stronger than in past cycles. I\u2019m confident that will make the next rebound bigger and much more sustainable.",

States, heavily burdened by debt, are forced to print increasing amounts of money to inflate their liabilities away, and the circulating money supply has multiplied as a result. Also that the world is deflationary by standard trough Innovation in technology.\n\nBut investing in a diversified ETF or real estate also protects against inflation while generating real value trough rental income in property or business profits in equity markets. Bitcoin, by contrast, creates value only even higher bidding.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that traditional saving in currencies like the dollar or euro is flawed because of inflation.\n\nI recognize Bitcoin\u2019s strengths: decentralization, mobility, protection against censorship, and so on. I think it\u2018s much better than Gold!\n\nHowever, why should Bitcoin continue to rise so dramatically if a similar asset like gold is viewed primarily as a defensive hedge rather than a high-risk, high-return asset?\n",

            "selftext": "It is astonishing to see how na\u00efve the average joe is (90% of you guys). Then again, it's the same people that fall for rug pulls of something called \"cumcoin\" and cry they got scammed. Let's also add how desperate the average joe is to get rich that he will buy the course of a 17-year-old for $999 that \"teaches\" how to trade crypto.\n\nDoes anyone know the basics of economics/money? For someone to win, someone has to lose. There is almost no exception to this rule, ever.\n\nDo you people actually believe that crypto is your lottery ticket? Do you people really think it\u2019s that easy and obvious to get rich? Do you even understand what made crypto valuable and what it was intended for and, most importantly, why the majority of the coins have become worthless?\n\nI will try to very quickly break it down and you don\u2019t need to be smart to see the picture.\n\nBitcoin as a concept is one of the greatest inventions of this century. It became a valuable currency in 2013, specifically in May when the creators of a Costa Rican digital currency called Liberty Reserve (LR), along with all assets, were shut down by authorities. This was at the time the main black-market bank, and the majority of transactions on the black market were done through LR, including murders, drugs, guns, human trafficking, with the biggest market on the dark web being child pornography. A lot of sick fucks in the world.\n\nWhen the main currency of the online criminal world vanished, the whole economy froze for 24 hours until some of the main forums at the time made a thread introducing a new currency to be adopted called BTC, which at that time was around $80\u2013$300, and by the end of May was in the $1000s.\n\nBitcoin was literally the financial-institution killer. It was decentralized, cheap to buy, fast processing, low fees, fully anonymous at the time, and what really sealed the deal and made it absolutely perfect was the fact that the wallets at the time were all offline, so unless you lost your computer or USB, you would never lose your money.\n\nNow all the things I listed that made Bitcoin valuable are no longer true, except for the fact that it\u2019s the online criminal currency.\n\nUnderstand this very carefully: you are only buying into a currency where its only real value is funding criminal activity. Now let me put the nail in the coffin so you really understand where it\u2019s headed:\n\nThe integration of Bitcoin into day-to-day life would\u2019ve absolutely crippled the government and financial institutions. People could do transactions anonymously, tax-free, and nearly impossible to seize. This would\u2019ve meant that you truly own your money which, for banks and government, would mean losing control. However, since it became mainstream, the value has been manipulated to fluctuate to ensure that it\u2019s unusable day-to-day.\n\nNow you believe Bitcoin is going to 10 million? How about you go to Tesla and try to buy one with crypto\u2014see what they say. What about Walmart or Amazon? Why don\u2019t they accept crypto if it's the future? Even better, why aren't people on a daily basis amongst each other using crypto as a currency to pay each other for small things, even like paying someone back for covering your lunch when you forgot your wallet?\n\nAre you people able to see things more clearly? The market is manipulated. As it is right now, apart from being the currency for criminals (and even criminals find it hard to do business when the $10 of BTC they received is worth $6 the next day and $14 the next), crypto has been stripped of any actual value in terms of use. This is literally how to make money from shit.\n\nThe question you should ask yourself isn't IF it will drop, it\u2019s WHEN. The mastermind whales who bought into this early and have massive influence to manipulate the market are not only coming out of this insanely wealthy, but most of the profits will be under the table and none of us are ever going to know who, what, where, and why.\n\nDon\u2019t be stupid. Don\u2019t think you can look at some graph and put some lines around it and become an oracle. You only win by knowing or having access to information nobody knows yet. And doing this works so well that it will land you in jail for 20 years for \u201cinsider trading.\u201d\n\nIf you made money from this up to this point, you are already a winner, so take your profit out and buy real estate if you want guaranteed assets.\n\nBut none of you will do that because most of the people who are deeply invested into this at the core are gambling addicts, not investors.\n\nWith that said, I wish you all the best of luck and, for the sake of some of you, pray to God I\u2019m just an idiot who doesn\u2019t know anything and I am wrong.",

The card, now available in more than 50 markets across Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, allows users to make payments with stablecoins through major networks like Visa and Mastercard.\n\nAccording to the company, the system identifies standard card related fees and issues refunds to offset them. The card also supports self custody, meaning users keep control of their assets rather than relying on a third party. They says it will also offer customizable versions of the card and plans to release co-branded options with partner companies.\n\nThe launch comes as stablecoin usage continues to increase globally, with more people using digital assets for everyday transactions.",

Binance did not delist ONE, according to Coingecko, but still I can't sell it. After years of waiting for nothing and watching my portfolio going down, I lost all my hope in alts so I want to get rid of everything.\n\nI am in trouble with RNDR also. I am not able to sell it on Coinbase anymore since it turned into RENDER. What should I do with these?  \n(+some more characters so I can post this.............................................................................)",

There are three tiers of institutional mining - tier 3 these guys operate on old equipment and they spend 60-90k per BTC mined. These guys are beginning to fall into trouble. The longer we linger around  these price levels and operating at a loss, eventually they will capitulate, this creates a cascading effect to a point where if we see 45k BTC this bear, ALL tier 3 and many tier 2 Mining firms die or are close to dying. Tier 1 mining firms with the best equipment at this point will survive indefinitely.\n\nAs tier 3 and tier 2 mining firms die off, the Hash rate and difficulty to mine BTC also falls off a cliff, this allows Tier 1 mining firms to grow exponentially; eating all the tier 2 mining companies that go bust.\n\nWe are inevitably faced with the elephant in the room. This is the Cycle where the ultra rich take over BTC. we will find ourselves in a position that the majority of Bitcoins Hashrate will be in the hands of just a few entities.

And I honestly don\u2019t understand the logic behind it.\n\nIf you *don\u2019t* sell, it\u2019s just an unrealised loss. The price can recover. BTC has had countless dips before and recovered, sometimes even within the same month. But once you sell low, that\u2019s it - the loss becomes real and you\u2019re out.\n\nWhy not just hold through the volatility instead of panic selling? What\u2019s the point of selling when you know you\u2019re taking a hit?",

            "selftext": "Look, I'm not pro, I don't even have that much money in crypto since I had decided to start investing and playing with Crypto since 2020 (if I'm not mistaken). Over the years, I have lost a lot of money, but just a lot that I don't feel like unalive myself. I win some, I lose some. \n\nBut over the years, I learn ONE thing. Every rise, there's a fall. ALWAYS. Especially in crypto, that rise and fall are in the extreme range. Especially if BTC hits a new ATH. All other coin are still pretty much riding BTC wave in both ways (up or down). At this point, everyone who have been in crypto trading long enough would have known this. So this message is more to the new, novice buyer. Nothing you see here is new, this is crypto trading nature. I've been through this same cycle since 2020, and seen that too in the years before. \n\nAgain, I'm not a pro, but if I can guess, we are in the bear market now. It will brutal, it will be for awhile, then it will starts to trend sideway for a long time until maybe 4 years? Who really knows (The next halving probably). So in the meantime if I know it will keep going down, why not reap the benefits on the way down? \n\nOfc, I don't always win. Hell, my win rate sucks. Just a week ago I did this, a fake out liquidate my trade. Lesson learned: don't do trade in between lobby match lmao. I panicked a bit, thinking BTC would rise before falling, so I put a long trade, thinking it could go up to my desired value and close my trade. But it never reached that point, in fact it was only 100point away before it crash all the way down. So, it's obvious to me: it is bear country now. So the safest thing probably to keep shorting (but play it safe). AND NEVER GAMBLE YOUR LIFE SAVING AWAY.\n\nTldr: if you bought your coin, BTC or whatever, don't sell it if you don't want to realized your loss now. Keep hodl, and take opportunity now. At least for BTC, we know from history it will reach higher; we just don't know when",

Apparently, he had mailed his seed phrase to his e-mail address, which led to someone transfering the funds out of his wallet. It may have been his secretary as she has had access to his mailbox.\n\nOne of the transactions:  \n[8b08ae1d18801e0d576e12ab26a51cef52a283c0c9aae257da3234501ebb1027](https://mempool.space/tx/8b08ae1d18801e0d576e12ab26a51cef52a283c0c9aae257da3234501ebb1027)  \nsent the funds to a legacy (P2PKH) address: [1GDkra31bUnfRPagqFe4KMr2yZQaqvwRY9](https://mempool.space/address/1GDkra31bUnfRPagqFe4KMr2yZQaqvwRY9). Based on my understanding, this address may potentially be a deposit address for a large exchange, such as Binance.\n\nThe owner of the wallet was a Polish citizen living in the US, at the time when some of the funds were transferred out, he was staying in Poland. His will was stored with a lawyer in the US, and the heirs live in the US.\n\nHow can we figure out which of the exchanges the funds were transferred to? Do we report the theft in Poland or in the US?\n\nEdit: The owner of the wallet died on May 22, 2023. The transaction in question was created in 2024.",

The mix of collateral is broadening beyond just BTC, pointing to more confidence and deeper liquidity versus the post-2022 reset.Key numbers:\n\n* Collateralized crypto debt this quarter: $73.59B\n* CeFi open borrows: $24.37B\n* Galaxy average loan book: $1.8B (up QoQ)\n* N\u0435x\u043e loan book: $2.04B, 69% YoY\n   * Collateral split: 54% BTC, 32% alts, remainder stables/other\n* Loan-book snapshots: Tether $14.6B, N\u0435x\u043e $2.04B, Galaxy Digital $1.8B\n\nBorrowers are tapping credit against positions rather than selling, and the leverage behind it is largely secured, unlike the unsecured excesses of 2021\u20132022. As desks accept a broader collateral set, liquidity deepens and holders get a cleaner way to access capital without dumping tokens.   \n  \nCredit demand is heating up, and the pipes look healthier this time.\n\nFinal take - these numbers show us we shouldn't be scared of the dip, we just have to use it wisely.",

And the higher the price, the lower the volatility should become.\n\nLet's hope that this all corrects, but be prepared for pain if you're a BTC holder.",

The team at Aptos Labs is targeting a mainnet launch in Q1 2026.\n\nDecibel has been one of the most watched products coming out of Aptos Labs because it leans on the chain\u2019s speed, finality, and low latency. The testnet gives everyone a chance to get a feel for it before things go live.\n\nHere is what the current testnet offers.\n\n1. Traders can try the interface, place trades, and move up a leaderboard that is meant to feed into priority access once mainnet arrives.\n\n\n2. Builders get access to APIs and starter code so they can begin experimenting or integrating Decibel into their own work.\n\n\n\nBy the way, if you took part in the MegaETH sale, there is a pre deposit page open. You can submit your wallet there to line up early access once deposits open.\n\nSome of the core features of Decibel:\n\n\u2022 Decibel Liquidity Provider vaults that handle market making and liquidations across all listed markets. These are designed for users who want passive yield style strategies.\n\n\u2022 Onchain risk management supported by Gauntlet. The risk engine runs onchain, which separates it from many perp DEX designs that still rely on offchain logic.\n\n\u2022 A full set of advanced order types including Market, Limit, Stop Limit, Stop Market, and TWAP.\n\n\u2022 Fees that adjust based on a user\u2019s trading volume and the liquidity they supply. Lower fees come with higher thirty day rolling volume.\n\nPerp DEXs are still early in their broader cycle. If you follow Aptos development or onchain trading engines in general, the Decibel testnet is a good place to see how the design feels and where it might fit in the growing perp landscape.\n\nFeel free to test it out here: https://decibel.trade/",

Whereas others are strongly disagreeing with that.\n\nMy question is what are you all doing amidst the current market conditions? Are you going to continue HODLing into the potential red or cash out and rebuy later if it does hit that speculated amount? ",

The Christmas Trigger (December 2025 - February 2026)**  \nWhy now?\n\n* **Fiscal Year End:**\u00a0Mining companies need to close their books. They cannot show massive losses to shareholders.\n* **Holiday OpEx:**\u00a0Operational expenses skyrocket in winter (heating/cooling balance, holiday bonuses, tax season preparation).\n* **Liquidity Need:**\u00a0Miners need\u00a0cash\u00a0to pay debts, not Bitcoin.\n\nThis creates a\u00a0**forced selling event**. The weak miners will dump their treasuries to survive the winter. This selling pressure will tank the price, pushing the mid-tier miners into insolvency. This is the\u00a0**Death Spiral**.\n\n**3. The Timelines: Two Points of Failure**\n\n* **Scenario A (The Immediate Crash): Dec 2025 \u2013 Feb 2026.**\u00a0This is the most likely scenario. The combination of the post-halving revenue drop and end-of-year financial pressure breaks the miners' backs. We see a cascade of bankruptcies, dragging the price down to production cost levels (`30k\u221230\\`\\`k\\`\\`\u2212\\` 40k).\n* **Scenario B (The Delayed Death): 2028 Halving.**\u00a0If the market somehow manipulates the price to keep miners alive now, it only delays the inevitable. The next halving (1.5625 BTC reward) is the mathematical hard stop. Unless BTC hits $300k+ by 2028, the entire mining infrastructure becomes economically unviable. The crash then will be final.\n\n**4. The Macro Contagion (The Evergrande Link)**  \nCrypto is no longer isolated. A mining collapse kills demand for semiconductors (TSMC/Samsung) and hits energy contracts.  \nThis liquidity crunch will expose the global \"zombie economy,\" specifically the fragile Chinese real estate sector (Evergrande legacy). When crypto liquidity evaporates, margin calls will ripple through Asian markets, triggering a global recession similar to 1929 or 2008.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe chart looks bullish to retail, but the engine room (mining) is on fire.  \nWatch the\u00a0**Miner Revenue per Terahash**. If it dips further, the capitulation begins.\n\nCash is King right now. Good luck.\n\n**UPDATE 2: CONTAGION ($81k Broken)**\n\n* **UTC:**\u00a010:11\n* **New York (EST):**\u00a005:11.\n* **London (GMT):**\u00a010:11\n\nWe just lost\u00a0**$82k**. The speed of this drop confirms that liquidity has evaporated.\n\nLook at the Alts (SOL, ETH). They are bleeding faster than BTC. Why? Because when miners dump Bitcoin to pay bills, market makers pull liquidity from Altcoins to cover their margin calls.\n\n**The dominoes are falling exactly as the model predicted.**\n\nNext critical zone:\u00a0**$78k**. If we lose that tonight, we will see a flash crash to the low $70s by the weekend.\n\nI repeat:\u00a0**Cash is King.**\u00a0Do not buy the dip. The dip has just started.",

A few mid-age coins (around 6\u201324 months old) sold into strength first, price rolled over, and then the **7\u201360d crowd** did most of the panic selling. The oldest holders barely moved. \n\nKeep in mind, on the top chart the green bar measures the percentage of coin movement that was older than 7 days for that block. when the green bar is low, it means the block was almost entirely churn for <7 day old coins.\n\n**What the chart shows**\n\n* **Top:** who spent coins (by age) as the day unfolded.\n* **Bottom:** whether those spends were at a profit or loss.\n* Takeaway: this looks like a **support test led by newer holders**, not a big exit from long-term holders.\n\n**What I\u2019m watching next**  \nIf we see green candles with older bands taking small profits... and overall \u22657d activity ticking up... bounces tend to stick.

It\u2019s changed my life but I feel like it\u2019s not done yet, I agree that this cycle is over and the bear market begins for the next 1-2 years it\u2019s good that my patience is unmatched. I\u2019ve been watching bitcoin since 2017 but never had the money to put in and set for my future until now. I personally feel like the next 5 years will be the greatest for bitcoin. We won\u2019t see incredible growth in terms of money anymore but I believe we will see it fall into a middle ground of institutional adoption, and keep the appeal of decentralization. Decentralization will stay the core of bitcoin along with private ownership and unmatched ease of use. It just takes time. The people in charge are still old and don\u2019t understand quite like new generations but imagine when everyone understands it beyond \u201cjust a cycle.\u201d or \u201cjust a risk asset\u201d Bitcoin is the future of simplicity, complexity, and efficiency all in one. I believe that soon bitcoin will be around $350,000-$500,000 per coin. Soon is 5-10 years. In 2010 mcap was 1.5 million; 2015 6.5billion, 2020 560billion, and now it is 1.8 trillion. Bitcoins growth and purpose is undeniable and everyone knows it but still refuses to believe it. 80% of people say crypto is garbage but the 20% knows better and now its increasing as more and more understand.

Last time I bought was end of august after a juicy dip. Then price went through the roof and of course it was so nice to see my networth build up, but I tend to stop buying in those moments. Today I suddenly felt the price was a bargain (86900$). It's weird cause after riding through the entire last 4 year cycle I knew we could be entering a 1-2 years bear market but I feel like something changed. Call me crazy but I sold some etf world last week so now I have some liquidity and if btc drops more I still have some spare cash to takw advantage of the good price (-30% from ATH already)",

I know I am a noob, so I started reading up it, and I have questions. \n\nI know I want a software wallet installed on my PC, so which one?      Is BIP 39 compliance the current standard for recovering the wallet in case my chosen wallet network goes poof?          \nWhich wallets have been around the longest?          \nWhich of the 10+ wallets in Getting Started is least likely to show ads or generally be an annoyance?\nWhich is the least fidgeting (I am not into Linux or GitHub)\n\nAnd once I have the wallet, I have to go to an exchange to buy the Bitcoin, right? Which one?         \nWhat info will an honest exchange want to link to my wallet: public key? wallet \"address\"?          \nDo all exchanges work well with all wallets, or there are cliques?         \nWhat % of transaction fee is reasonable?           \n\nThanks for all the answers.

Today, most newcomers can only dream of affording to own one whole coin.\n\nJust a few decades from now, $1m salary will literally be middle class. When 1 BTC is worth that much (probably long before then), a single sotishi will cost... 1 penny.\n\nBy the end of this century, even a single sat will be worth so much that we'll have to divide it into another 100 million fragments just so it can be used to pay for everyday things. And it won't be unreasonable at all to see big ticket items like houses, and eventually even bigger things like business investments, going for just a handful of sats.\n\nHow many houses will you or your kids be able to buy with your current stack by then?",

Others would buy and hold (HODL) it, with the hope to sell it at the profit later.\n\nThe problem, however, was that the ingredients (aka blockchain technology) of the original cancer pill, were not a secret.\n\nSoon, other companies started to develop similar cancer pills, most much more efficient at killing cancer and much faster, some also producing limited quantities, others producing more.\n\nTo keep from going bankrupt, the developer of the original cancer pill, came up with a brilliant idea, to convinced the general public, through social media, brainwashing, false markering and pseudoscience, that:\n\n1. Our pills are original, unique and scarse. Curing cancer is not so important anymore.\n\n 2. All other cancer pills are \"shitpills\" \"generics\" and knock-offs of the original.\n\nPeople still paid top dollar for the original pills, although other pills worked much better and faster.\n\nThen, one day, people started to wake up to brainwashing.......hopefully soon.",

Like many others in this sub, who may have been in since even longer and who are now silently watching. \n\nI can tell you that this is the moment where you hodl, you stop obsessing over price action. And look long term. The fundamentals have not changed. Trying to time the market won't help you, this is how people lose their gains.  \nThey look at past charts and say, \"this is it, this is when you sell\", \"Winter is coming\" and other GoT shennanigans. And 90% of the time, thy fail, and lose it all. I've seen it countless times.   \n  \nTime in the market, beats timing the market. And this is especially true for bitcoin.   \n  \nHodl, is not just a meme or catch phrase. It is serious advice, that long term holders give.  \nHolding during these kind of volatile moments, that are actually quite stable compared to price movements of several years ago, is what allowed me to get gains personally. \n\nYou know that expression, \"pressure creates diamonds\" ? Holding, during these times is not easy, it takes willpower, and conviction. \n\nYou probably regret, with reason, not having been able to buy bitcoin in 2010, or in 2013, or in 2017 etc. The truth is, 1000s of people bought bitcoin at these moments in time, but only a small fraction were able to hold, during the ups and down. Because its not easy, but the rewards are worth it in the end.  ",

It\u2019s the p,rice you pay to be early\n\nIn this video I break down why Bitcoin\u2019s wild swings are exactly what create its long-term upside, and why most people confuse volatility with actual risk. If you understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin, you know the drawdowns are temporary, but the adoption curve is permanent.\n\nVolatility is not something to fear, but the cost of being early to the best money ever invented.",

Needless to say a lot of money was raised buying the top. \n\nNow that crypto appears to be in an endless nosedive how low does Bitcoin and ETH need to go before we see these same holding companies have to liquidate positions in order to pay back investors?

I'm on 3rd year in my university, need another 1.5 years to graduate because I failed some classes, I put 70k which is a year's tuition plus living fee (I'm an international student in Canada) on crypto in ETH ADA HBAR LINK PEPE (from largest to least) at the start of this year, because I trusted those influencers on Twitter about this is gonna be a great year for crypto so I wanna make some money for my master's degree in the future so I dont have to ask for my family. I'm now sitting at 35k, which I need 100% gain to gain all the losses back, but where are we now? we are heading to a crypto winter 2026. FCK MY LIFE.\n\nI still have 40k in my bank saving account which can last me for another year, but if crypto cannot recover, I dont know how I will survive 2027, I dont think my family can provide me another 60k, I'm not coming from a rich family, this money is like their life savings, and I cant imagine their reaction after knowing what I did, I'm just so hopless right now. I will rather end my life than telling them what stupid shit i have done, I'm caring their hope in a new country.\n\nSome other background of me if you decide to give me some advice: Im currently on an internship, my major is CS, the internship salary can barely cover my living cost, so that means if I can find another 4 months intern at fall 2026 that means my saving can help me last till end of that year. And my tuition for one semester is 19k, so 40k on saving is enough for 1 whole year's tuition. But I still need 60k for the final year.\n\nwhat should I do?\n\nfck my life! If I didnt touch this investing shit, none of this concerns and constant depression would happen this year, I almost break even this mid-august, I should sell everything and all in on Nasdaq to cover the rest 5%, but Im too fcking gready and think ETH will up to 8k this year and didnt sell shit. And now LINK ADA HBAR is like 50% down from august and pepe is looking like its going to zero, fuck all of this",

I've seen a lot of hate on Robin Hood, some bad opinions on Kraken, etc. so Coinbase it was. \nI've recently seen some people having problems with withdrawals on Coinbase when it comes to unusual amounts considering the individuals' norm. \nLot of people are loving the River Financial exchange, however it's only for US residents which I'm not. I live in the EU.\nI only started buying BTC about 6 month ago so I'm pretty fresh to this and so far I have everything in a custodial wallet. Should I move what I have into a cold wallet and use a different exchange for when I want to exchange for fiat, or what would be the best way of doing that (if it came to it)?\n \nOr maybe do something completely different? \n\nI'm very open to suggestions and advice of any kind. Please leave your insults at the door, I'm here hear your opinions on the matter :)",

If you look at all the outflows and everything that is happening, you could be led to believe that the sky has completely fell, and this will never recover. But then I think of the crash of 2022 and all of the people who went to jail. During that time everything seemed to be over and then bitcoin rallied to levels that we never imagined. So for all those people that said they wish they knew and wish that they would have picked up when things were at the bottom, I say this to you right now, do you have what it takes? Are you willing to take a leap of faith in that investment? Because at this exact moment, it could go down a lot more or it could go up even more than before. This is the moment.",

Question is not if, question is at what level... If u bought in late at 50K what u gonna do when it reaches 51?\n\nSo please forgive my blasphemy but these are my assumptions and I dont really wanna start the discussion that Im a non believer, this is all wrong, can only go up to 200K, hodl and so on. I dont mind your beliefs its ur investment.\n\n\nSo what Id like to discuss is...\nThere is so much money in BTC bein freed by selling. Ppl obviously into speculating...\nSo where does that money go? Its approx 2 TN in Usd in btc. So I wonder if it all goes down and ppl pull their money, where do they put it?\n\nSo maybe a question for the ppl who sold... Did u put it in the stockmarket? Risky stocks? \nStablecoins?\nDo u just park and wait?\n\nIf that money goes stickmarket, the rally could intensify I guess...\n\n\n",

But the trade-off is obvious: you\u2019re no longer holding Bitcoin you\u2019re holding exposure to it, packaged and filtered through the same institutions Bitcoin was built to bypass.\n\nBuying BTC through ETFs or shares of mining companies is like standing outside a shop window, staring at the item you want. You see it, you talk about it, you even profit from it. But you\u2019re not the one holding it in your hands Maybe that\u2019s fine for some. But it\u2019s not why Bitcoin was created! ",

We\u2019re a family that likes to gift really unique, epic, funny, experiences, and make fun memories. I just know they would have a field day and it would be the best gift. I\u2019m wondering how to go about this? \n\nI\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t exist but I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s like a merchandise gift card of some sorts that I could give them preloaded with $5 USD of Bitcoin. Not for them to use, but for them to know they own a piece of Bitcoin. \n\nI want to gift them something physical even if it\u2019s just a small piece of paper that has some key phrases on it to access, or making them a metal card or set of washers so I can stamp their keys into it. \n\nI don\u2019t want to get a trezor wallet or an actually wallet for each of them because that\u2019s too much money just to give them a $1-5 worth of bitcoin and that would be going down a hole of trying to teach them how to use it. \n\n",

While the market moves through this phase, I\u2019m keeping my approach simple staying focused on Bitcoin data, monitoring dominance trends, and remaining patient as the market stabilizes.\n\n  \nFor now, it\u2019s about maintaining awareness of Bitcoin\u2019s position in the current cycle and navigating the environment with caution until conditions show clearer signs of recovery.",

(fyi not really looking for opinions on that. it is what I want to do). That rules out coinbase and the other top exchanges.\n\nI went through the entire verification process on Bitpanda only to be rejected at the end bc I am American (my fault for not googling that prior to joining).\n\nSo does anyone have any suggestions for where to buy that is not US-based but still accepts Americans? This is only to buy - it will be directly transferred to a hard wallet.\n\nI would really like it to be in my name bc for the past 5 years all new assets and accounts I have opened in the EU, I did in my husband's name just because it was easier since he's an EU citizen ... and that is going to be a really stupid move if he ever decides to leave me. I have a Masters in Finance and in our house I am in charge of the money, but I have basically given all of my EU investment income/savings to him lol.\n\nI would like to start to move some of my american assets to the EU in my name, but given the bitcoin drop in price I don't really want to wait until I am an EU citizen (to buy a bit more).\n\nIs the answer Bitstamp? that seems to be the only one coming up when googling, but they also have a partnership with Robinhood, so I wasn't sure.\n\nAny insight is appreciated.",

Surely this is comparing apples to oranges, right?\u201d Well\u2026 let\u2019s look at some rough numbers.\n\n\nNearly 1/2 of all mined gold is bought by central banks, formed into bullion, or held by ETF\u2019s. This gold is either used as a store of value or speculated on.\n\n\nThe other 1/2 is almost exclusively used for jewelry. Thing is, gold jewelry demand is inextricably linked to the perceived value of gold; jewelry is arguably the less liquid, \u201cprettier\u201d sister of bullion, which folks flaunt in public instead of lock in a safe. \n\n\nI think people wouldn\u2019t care so much for gold jewelry if gold didn\u2019t have an inflated price via speculation / central banks\u2019 buying.\n\n\nMy point?\n\n\nNearly half of all gold mining is done to keep gold propped up as a store of value / speculative asset, and the other half mainly sees gold formed into bedazzled quasi-bullion.\n\n\nInteresting that ~0 bitcoin detractors display concern about the insane repercussions from gold mining.\n\n\nFood for thought: if BTC replaces gold as a store of value, does that mean bitcoin ends up a net benefit to the environment\u2026?",

But here's the paradox \u2013 if you stick to the timings and rely on what the high and low of Bitcoin might be within the periods, its price will never reach a million dollars.\n\nWhy? Because if we assume that the current bull run \u2013 without a drop after the halving and the euphoria stage \u2013 is over, then Bitcoin hasn't even doubled from its previous peak. Consequently, this factor should reflect in future cycles as well.\n\nSo, I suggest we adopt a different paradigm \u2013 one of increasing cycle inertia, the anomalies of which began with a double top last cycle, along with other minor inconsistencies in the process.\n\nOr, just short like everyone else, but forget about the million.",

The addition raised the country\u2019s reported holdings to 7,474 BTC, worth about $676 million at the time of disclosure. The purchase occurred at 6:01 p.m. Eastern time as short-term selling increased across the market. The update came from the nation\u2019s Bitcoin Office, and President Nayib Bukele later shared a screenshot of the transaction on his X account.\n\nThe latest purchase marked the largest single-day addition since the government adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. El Salvador has added 1 BTC daily since late 2022. Officials also tend to increase holdings during steep price declines.\n\nThe announcement followed a familiar pattern of accumulation during periods of market stress. The transaction also occurred during Bitcoin\u2019s lowest level since April. The country\u2019s earlier legal-tender decision positioned Bitcoin within national economic planning.",

Obviously, you'd want to spend a decent chunk of money to prevent large stolen flows. I've heard of sites like Code4rena and Immunefi, but I'm talking some sort of tool that analyzes your entire compiled repo and returns a huge mountain of issues from several different bug classes with the intent of mitigating potential critical vulnerabilities pre-deployment. The audit should include mitigation steps and dynamic exploit generation.\n\nAll answers are greatly appreciated! This is just to better understand my fellow developers as I don't want to (a) overspend or (b) underspend on this class of tools.\n\n",

            "selftext": "During tax season you can export a pdf from coinbase of crypto losses and capital gains which can then be uploaded to turbotax.\n\nMy question is..\n\nIf I used coinbase 4 years ago to buy bitcoin and sent that bitcoin to a ledger.. then today from the same ledger convert that bitcoin to USDC.. then send that USDC from the ledger to my coinbase to convert to fiat to transfer to my bank account.. how will coinbase interpret where the USDC came from and how will it determine a capital gain? Will coinbase see the transaction as just random USDC that 'appeared' in my account and tax it without considering it was actually converted from bitcoin purchased 4 years ago from my coinbase account?\n\nAnother thing.. I bought some $pepe 2 years ago and sent it to my ledger. 1 year ago I sent that $pepe to my coinbase. I believe coinbase is looking at the transfer as if the value of the $pepe received was whatever the price was 1 year ago (when I transferred the pepe to coinbase).. because coinbase is saying my pepe bag is in a loss and that my average price is X when in reality I bought the pepe for much less than X and am actually in profit, not a loss like coinbase seems to think... I hope all of that makes sense.\n\nThe whole thing is confusing and I don't understand how it works when sending coins off of coinbase and then receiving coins on coinbase as far as taxes go and how coinbase interprets gains/losses in that regard. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

            "selftext": "Over the years, many people (myself included) believed BTC was still the digital cash Satoshi described. But once you look beneath the surface, it becomes clear that since 2017 BTC has abandoned that mission. It\u2019s no longer usable peer-to-peer money \u2014 just a store of value with high fees and slow transactions.\n\nThe Lightning Network is constantly promoted as the \u201csolution,\u201d but anyone who has used it knows it\u2019s centralized, unreliable, and can freeze funds. That\u2019s not what decentralized electronic cash looks like.\n\nFor peer-to-peer digital money to work, it must be fast, cheap, and accessible for everyday people \u2014 not limited by fees, congestion, or complex side-systems. Most people only discover the truth when they try to send a simple wallet-to-wallet transaction and get hit by delays or fees that make no sense for daily payments.\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news: the real Bitcoin didn\u2019t die. It continues as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) \u2014 the version of Bitcoin that still works globally, with fees that cost fractions of a cent and a system anyone can use without intermediaries. BCH keeps Satoshi\u2019s vision alive: simple payments, personal financial sovereignty, and privacy tools like CashFusion.\n\nNewcomers deserve to understand this reality. BTC was hijacked, but Bitcoin itself was not destroyed. It lives on through BCH.\n\nIf my writing helps you or resonates with you, any support is appreciated \u2014 whether it\u2019s sharing, tipping, or simply spreading the message. It keeps me motivated to keep creating content for the BCH community.\n\nMy BCH address (QR included):\nbitcoincash:qp5wsnlhh8fesu42clk9z7ztq7l32ck57savwmcx44\n\nRead more in a full article:\n1. https://read.cash/@alberdioni8406/why-btc-failed-as-money-and-why-bch-didnt-0cbe725c\n2. https://www.publish0x.com/bitcoin-cash-bch-ecosystem/why-btc-failed-as-money-and-why-bch-didn-t-xkdnqvl\n3. https://bastyon.com/post?s=5e6e999ab2dcd538c44f770fadef2f4094851271b9e36270533a8f8ae5801277&ref=PPZwZcoqm3KYTwyD8KD3Xqdx5iFGurUyU2",

Nothing weird about it. I don't have any emotions attached to the current price. \n\nWhat CAN happen though, is one of the major exchanges going down, whether it be Coinbase, Binance, Kucoin, Bybit etc..... We don't know who it will be this time, so get your money off the exchanges. Learn about cold wallets. Own your keys, own your crypto. \n\nYou don't lose money unless you sell. Watching the price fluctuate drastically is a part of the game. If you're not willing to hold for a long time, bitcoin is not for you. Dollar value is not the goal, owning more BTC regardless of the price is the goal. \n\nKeep educating yourself, the space is evolving, since 2020 it's evolved a lot, and the more I learn, the more I only want BTC and not the other tokens. \n\nKeep strong, don't lose hope, BTC always recovers, and always will. \n\nPeace ",

            "selftext": "It turns out that a lot of institutions if not all, buy bitcoin ETF to execute the basis trade. For those who don't know what it is, you basically long spot holding and short the future to maintain delta neutral. As future expiration nears, cost to carry disappears and future price converges to spot price and you make some money from the difference. We have been seeing institutions disclosing that they hold btc ETF from their 13f because regulators don't require them to publicly disclose their hedge short position. They harvest good yields from basis trade when the sentiment is bullish and leveraged longs are in demand. I think there are both good and bad ways to interpret this. I will get the bad way outta the way first. I think it's bad because it seems like institutions haven't really participated. They just saw an additional way to take more money from retails without exposing themselves to risk of bitcoin since the ones that are susceptible to be euphoric and pile in on leveraged longs are usually retails. The good way to interpret this is that bitcoin is still more of a retail driven asset class and way less mainstream than what it appears so the long term asymmetrical upside is still high.\n\nWhat is your opinion on the whole bitcoin basis trade situation?\n\n  \nTLDR:\n\nInstitution basis trades are the primary demand for spot ETF. Bad that institutions haven't really bought into bitcoin story as we thought. Good that it's still far from being mainstream asset so still a lot of potential upside.",

That\u2019s the short-term churn (the reason the numbers add up to more than 21m is because of how much of the short term simply trades back and forth) trying to time entries and exits.\n* The **older bands** (multi-month to multi-year coins) are overwhelmingly on the **profit side** when they finally move.\n* In other words, every UTXO that survives long enough tends to be sitting on a cushion \u2014 it\u2019s the frequent flipping in the short-term bands that crystallizes losses.\n\nThis is why \u201ctiming\u201d Bitcoin with constant in-and-out trades is so hard. The chain keeps showing the same pattern:  \n**short-term traders provide liquidity and often realize the drawdowns, while long-term holders mostly wait until the move is obviously in their favor before they spend.**\n\nChart and data from my local node",

One thing is 100% a fact, they will always print more money because they have too.

            "selftext": "Bitcoin is back around the 90k level after dipping below it again this week and honestly the damage from that October 10th liquidation event is still haunting the market. We are down nearly 30 percent from the roughly 126k high and the move has basically erased this years gains.\n\nThat crash triggered over 19 billion dollars in forced liquidations over roughly a 24 hour window the largest wipeout the crypto market has ever seen. Since then institutional style demand has clearly weakened. Spot bitcoin ETFs flipped from steady inflows to heavy outflows with BlackRocks iShares Bitcoin Trust seeing about 523 million dollars leave in a single day this week its biggest daily outflow since launch.\n\nWhat makes this worse is people are still using high leverage trying to time the bottom. Open interest in bitcoin perpetual futures on major venues like Binance jumped by more than 36k BTC last week worth over 3.3 billion dollars the biggest weekly increase since April 2023 according to K33 Research.\n\nK33 is warning that perp open interest has reached its October peak again which systematically increases the risk of another squeeze. They argue a lot of this leverage came from resting limit orders to buy the dip near the recent lows that got filled as price slid with no real bounce leaving traders in leveraged positions they werent really prepared for. Historically when this kind of setup shows up bitcoin tends to lose more ground K33 notes that in six out of seven similar regimes over the past five years BTC went on to fall over the next month with average 30 day returns around minus 16 percent.\n\nThis is also the kind of market that quietly turns into a tax nightmare later because people are churning positions with tiny pnl swings and a lot of leverage. I have been using awaken lately to keep all the trades and liquidations in one place for 8949 and schedule d so future me doesnt have to reconstruct this chaos from old csvs.\n\nUntil institutional buyers actually come back were probably gonna keep bleeding.",

            "selftext": "I entered my BTC position 10/28 with a goal of getting to *one millionnnn* Satoshi's and then starting a DCA schedule. I have experimented with multiple exchanges with the objective of spending minimal fees and the option of taking possession of the BTC immediately, and want to share what I have found to be the most cost effective way to DCA for fellow shrimp wallets in New York. \n\nThis assumes a few things: \n\n1. KYC and anonymity is not a crucial aspect of your buying  \n2. You want to pay with a debit card  \n3. You want to cold store in a wallet   \n4. You live in NY, as there may be better options.   \n5. If you know a better way please @ me bro. \n\nTLDR: **Use CashApp**, auto invest feature for **zero** fees, and no spread, and transfers over 100,000 Satoshi's to our cold storage have **zero** CashApp fees, aside the standard blockchain transaction fee, it is completely free. \n\n  \nReasons others did not fit:   \n  \n**strike:** not available in NY, does not tell you this. Rather has you submit your ID, face scan, etc. just to tell you account is under review. You must independently google. 3 weeks later and no communication since 'signing up'.\n\n**Fidelity:** You can only fund your account through settled individual account funds. Meaning you have to transfer money into the account, wait for it to settle, transfer to Crypto account in which you can buy instantly. However, there is a wait period of >10 days at times to be able to withdraw your funds to your wallet. If you try to 'withdraw all' from available funds it coincidentally always gives you an error. \n\n**RobinHood:** Cannot self custody \n\n**CoinBase:** I do not like the interface, did not really explore too much\n\n**Gemini:** I bought around 200,000 Satoshi's, tried to link my wallet and said the account was restricted. AI support, to AI emails, additional verification through their portal of face and passport, no email response from human. Two days later there is an AI email asking to confirm 'Why I want to withdraw my BTC, What is the wallet address, and who owns the wallet'. Ultimately had to provide this info (snarkily, and generically), file a CFPB complaint to get a response 5 days later that the account is unfrozen. Withdrew everything and kept the app for the screen widget. ",

To give Martti a head start on this task, Satoshi attached dozens of previous email answers he had already given to people asking about Bitcoin, before May 2009.\n\nOne of these attached answers matches up exactly with the above private Hal Finney email on Nov 19th 2008: [https://mmalmi.github.io/satoshi/#email-3](https://mmalmi.github.io/satoshi/#email-3)\n\n[Image of Satoshi's Response to Hal](https://imgprxy.stacker.news/UrVfdnO_1dSU4pcoH_4EEW-PZLLavFPwdFuebL5v_Qw/rs:fit:2560:1440/aHR0cHM6Ly9tLnN0YWNrZXIubmV3cy8xMTg0MTM)\n\nIt appears we have a match.\n\nHappy 17th anniversary to Satoshi and Hal Finney's Bitcoin discourse. And thank you Martti Malmi for making this email match possible.\n\nA detailed video read through on this chapter in Bitcoin history here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1cQk77cqDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1cQk77cqDA)\n\nmedium article of this write up: [https://medium.com/@Fiach\\_dubh/new-satoshi-puzzle-piece-discovered-0ce632040a21](https://medium.com/@Fiach_dubh/new-satoshi-puzzle-piece-discovered-0ce632040a21)  \n\nIf you want to support more content like this, please visit my store at [shopbitcoin.shop](https://shopbitcoin.shop/) (i'll take bitcoin if you DM me your order. 21% discount on whitepapers with code WHITEPAPER)",

Finally I received the expected email with the link to a repository with node.js code, that I am supposed to download and execute locally in order to finish a homework before proceeding to the interview.\n\nAll links are below. If someone has a good idea how to screw them over let me know. Because linkedin is sh1t and only has a general report button that won't show up anywhere. Whereas the send the scammy link via email anyway, so linkedin is not goin to do anything.\n\nReport the company on linkedin as a \"fraud or scam\" and their associated profiles (mostly from Ukraine):\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/company/omisoftnet/posts/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/omisoftnet/posts/)\n\nReport the profile of the fake recuriter and any omisoft employee with linkedin premium (they use those for phishing).\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeline-l%C3%A9on-99b17410/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeline-l%C3%A9on-99b17410/)\n\nReport the bitbucket repo (AND PLEASE DONT EXECUTE THE CODE):\n\n[https://bitbucket.org/web3\\_techteam\\_project/ethvault\\_staking\\_project/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/web3_techteam_project/ethvault_staking_project/src/master/)\n\nOmisoft Omnisoft Omisoftnet [https://omisoft.net/](https://omisoft.net/)\n\nAdditional advice: Tell anyone who asks you to do unpaid homework in order to get a job to go fk themselves.\n\nMore links:  \n[https://linktr.ee/omisoft?utm\\_source=ig&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_content=link\\_in\\_bio](https://linktr.ee/omisoft?utm_source=ig&utm_medium=social&utm_content=link_in_bio)",

To everyone \"buying the dip\" You're not wrong. The price will be much higher in the future. The issues is when. You must be prepared for it to go much lower without selling and you must be cautious putting in money at this time. There is significant market volitility at the moment on the noncrypto side. If there is a significant stock market fall off it will take crypto with it temporarily as well. I would not be at all surprised if we see 68k or lower again this cycle. Be cautious putting in your whole bag, be ready to stomach the real drop when it happens. Hodl forever and I am sure we will all be sitting pretty in 5-10. Not financial advise just a firm warning to question all these memes on the front page telling you to buy now and the bottom is in. The real ride has only just begun. Godspeed friends. ",

            "selftext": "I've been thinking about how Bitcoin could work as actual money instead of just an investment, and I can't figure out how loans would work in that system. Maybe im missing something obvious but it doesn't add up for me. With regular banking, when you borrow $100 at 5% interest, you owe back $105. That works fine because the money supply can expand. Banks create money when they make loans, and the Fed can adjust things as needed. But Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins. You literally cannot create more. So if someone loans out 1 BTC at 5% interest, the borrower owes back 1.05 BTC. Where does that extra 0.05 BTC come from? It has to come from someone else's Bitcoin since you can't print more. This makes it a zero-sum game where money just gets redistributed instead of created. Heres where it gets worse. If the economy grows but there's a fixed amount of Bitcoin, each coin becomes worth more over time. More goods and services are being produced, but the same amount of currency exists, so you get deflation. That sounds great if your saving because your money buys more later. But if you borrowed money, your screwed. Example, Say I borrow 100 BTC when the average wage is 10 BTC per year. Thats about 10 years of income to pay it back. Ten years later, the economy has grown by 34% but now wages are only 7.4 BTC per year because of deflation. I still owe 100 BTC, but now that represents 13.5 years of income instead of 10. The debt burden increased by 35% even though I didn't borrow any more money. This is basically the debt-deflation spiral that made the Great Depression so devastating. As money becomes more valuable and wages drop in nominal terms, existing debts become harder and harder to repay. So what are the possible solutions? Fractional reserve banking - Banks could lend out more BTC than they actually have in reserve. But isnt this just recreating the fiat system that Bitcoin was supposed to replace? Full reserve banking - Only lend out the BTC you actually possess. But then interest payments become purely redistributive, and deflation still crushes borrowers under increasing debt burdens. Negative interest rates - Some people mentioned this idea where lenders would actually charge negative nominal interest. You'd loan 1 BTC and get back 0.98 BTC, but that 0.98 BTC would have more purchasing power than the original 1 BTC due to deflation. This is mathematically possible but seems weird in practice. Bitcoin-backed loans - This is what Coinbase and Strike already do. You use Bitcoin as collateral but borrow in dollars or stablecoins. Avoids the deflation problem and capital gains taxes. But doesn't this just mean Bitcoin remains a speculative asset instead of actual currency? If loans are denominated in fiat, Bitcoin hasn't really replaced the dollar. Shift to equity instead of debt - Maybe the whole concept of lending changes and everything gets funded through ownership stakes instead. But how would regular people finance things like houses or emergency medical expenses? What I'm still confused about, Even if Bitcoin's deflation rate stabilizes over time, wouldnt any economic growth create some deflationary pressure in a fixed-supply system? And wouldn't that always make debt harder to repay? If Bitcoin loans are all denominated in fiat with BTC as collateral, then Bitcoin is still just a speculative asset, not a real currency. Why would that be better than the current system? For people who genuinely need credit - medical emergencies, education, starting a business - how would that work in a deflationary currency without creating debt crises?",

            "selftext": "As part of Brink's mission to ensure the safety and robustness of the open-source Bitcoin Core software, we recently sponsored an independent security audit of the Bitcoin Core codebase.\n\nThis represents the first public, third-party audit of Bitcoin Core.\n\n[https://brink.dev/blog/2025/11/19/bitcoin-core-security-audit/](https://brink.dev/blog/2025/11/19/bitcoin-core-security-audit/)\n\nThe assessment was conducted by Quarkslab and was coordinated with the help of the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF). Funding was provided by Brink with the support of our donors, with technical collaboration from Brink engineer, Niklas G\u00f6gge, and Chaincode Labs engineer, Antoine Poinsot.\n\nWhy Brink funded this work\n\nThe project has a strong security track record, but it has never undergone an external security assessment. We wanted to provide an additional layer of assurance for developers, node operators, holders, and businesses who rely on Bitcoin Core every day\n\nWhat the audit involved\n\nThe focus was on the most security-critical components of the software, including the peer-to-peer networking layer, mempool, chain management, and consensus logic and included:\n\n\\- Manual code review  \n\\- Static and dynamic analysis  \n\\- Advanced fuzz testing\n\nWhat the auditors found\n\nThe auditors at Quarkslab reported no critical, high, or medium-severity issues. They identified two low-severity findings and thirteen informational recommendations, none of which were classified as security vulnerabilities under Bitcoin Core\u2019s criteria.\n\nFunding independent reviews like this is just one way we help ensure Bitcoin doesn\u2019t break and continues to serve the world as a secure, reliable monetary network.\n\nIndependent review only strengthens that confidence.\n\nThank you to Quarkslab, the OSTIF, Niklas, and Antoine for their work on this project.\n\nThe full report is publicly available here:\n\n[https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/25-05-2133-REP-bitcoincore-security-assessment-V1.3.pdf](https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/25-05-2133-REP-bitcoincore-security-assessment-V1.3.pdf)",

Contact a lawyer first and have them reach out to the exchange?  Reach out to the exchange yourself ahead of time to give them a heads up on the trade?  Full send with zero worry?\n\nWhat amount would be 'too much' for you to start worrying?  $10k?  $100k?  $100k to Coinbase is chump change given their liquidity but what if you bought in 2010 and now have over a billion dollars?",

            "selftext": "I know I will be roasted for this MY OPINION. But I don't care, it's my thinking. Nobody cares either when people shill their bags.\n\nCrypto is not a regular market. Ups and downs are normal for markets. But regular markets have underlying real, tangible value. Stuff. There's no stuff behind 95% (made up figure to make my point) of crypto.\n\nCrypto is rather gambling. And as such, it doesn't need to be overly regulated or even banned. But gambling is very different than a market. Especially psychologically to people. It's definitely NO economic game changer. Try your luck at your own risk.\n\nAs it's purely digital and virtual, there's no bottom and there's no roof at to where the price can go. Which swings widely and wlidly mostly on pure sentiment. There's no real economic metric underpinning the movements. There are not a whole lot of economy affecting jobs (well, devs, influencers, comms managers, marketing for sure) behind it, nor materials, nor services. Not even utility!\n\nThere are a handful of exceptions. Bitcoin of course can be perceived as digital gold. But it's not doing a great job at it. Unlike physical gold, bitcoin can go as low as it gets. It's price is too speculative to function as gold. Every asset sees price moves, but from a digital gold - by MY INDIVIDUAL expectation  - I expect SOME stability and predictability. And right when I need my asset to give me stability - in terms of hedging when things look concerning - it tanks. It goes up when everything else goes up. That's NOT the utility of digital gold -> I <\u2010 am looking for.\n\nSome other coins have a bit of utility. Ethereum is hailed for its smart contracts - but it's mainly used for DeFi. Shuffling more virtual stuff around to make virtual profits (or losses) which you can ephimerally make. How's that different from gambling?\n\nAvalanche and a few other coins made one right move: anker their utility in real world stuff (RWA). But their market power is too weak to move on their own, and thus are subject to the general sentiments. Plus, regulatory and legal hurdles,  but also the actual handling of fractional or digitized ownership for people, needs more maturing.\n\nTherefore I conclude: crypto degenerated into (mostly) pure gambling. Mind you, no newcomer here, first heard about bitcoin in 2012. I was concerned about its energy use back then, or I would be rich now. But that's a different story.\n\nThe emperor has no clothes. But of course the shillers and whales don't want you to believe that.  \n\nThe problem is not the tech. I entered crypto because of its, well, liberating *potential*. But as always, the problem is the use humans give to tech. It could be used differently but 99% are not interested. ",

Honestly, it\u2019s become my go-to when I feel like using some leftover crypto sitting in my wallet. Payment was smooth as usual scan the QR, approve, and confirmation email lands in my inbox instantly. No weird delays, no extra hassle.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how something that once felt like a futuristic experiment is now just another normal way to pay. Honestly, if someone had told me a couple of years ago that I\u2019d be casually buying flights with crypto, I probably would have laughed.\n\nCurious how many of you have done this more than once? Do you stick to the same service, or mix it up? Any funny experiences paying for travel with crypto?",

Every one was insanely euphoric, bitcoin was up 3x the previous all time high and was up 1,700% (18x) from the 2015 lows of $163.\n\nPeople started to worry that bitcoin couldnt possibly go any higher, they said this bull market has already lasted longer than the 2013 bull market, then we started to fall. The price of bitcoin fell 40% all the way back down to $1,800 and **EVERYONE** started to say the bull market was over and $3,000 was the top.\n\nOne week later we were back up near $3,000 and we spent the next six months running higher from $3k all the way up to $20k.\n\nThis was the bear trap of 2017.\n\nThe same thing is happening today, we hit a high not even 2x the previous all time high, then fell 28% and **EVERYONE** is saying this is the end of the bull market.\n\nAs bitcoin gets bigger in size it will inevitably move slower and bull markets will get longer. The bull market isnt over just because it has lasted the same amount of time as the last bull market.\n\nThis current correction has all the hallmarks of a bear trap and it will convince everyone that the bull market is over. People will sell hoping to buy back lower, people will sell to try and realise some profits, people will close their leveraged long positions. Then all of a sudden we will pump 4 times faster than we fell taking us back to new highs so the real bull market can finally begin.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm new to reddit and new to BTC but the more I learn about it, the more it makes sense. \n\nI run a digital marketing business that will do around $65K in business in 2025 and $200K in 2026. \n\nTo ensure we are staying relevant and protect our assets for the long term. I have decided to allocate 5% of all of our revenue to BTC. \n\nI make this post because without Square offering this, I would have otherwise not been interesting in doing so. But with this incentive, I feel like it makes it so easy where I don't even have to think about it. \n\nFor me, this makes me excited about the future and we hope to eventually do our first transaction in only BTC.

            "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI am looking into joining a 6 month trading educational bootcamp that I found through the internet. I can't find much about them online, but my impression of the group leads me to think that it's more legitimate than the signal groups, whatsapp and telegram channels and million scams that are literally everywhere. Supposedly it is a 6 month, hands-on intensive educational program, not a trading position sharing group (pump and dump). I did a zoom call with someone, he showed me on his screen what the training environment consists of, it looks real enough but I am still feeling a bit uneasy. The zoom call left me feeling like I was being \\*pitched\\* towards committing the full tuition on the spot, which DEFINITELY is a red flag to me. I told the contact on the other end that I would need more time to consider if I'm going to join, which he, eventually, gave up on trying to talk me out of.\n\nSuen, on youtube, is very transparent and specific with his analysis price targets entires and key levels, acknowledges his incorrect calls and audits them publicly, generally seems like a much more legit online analyst than much of that sphere. But I'm not feeling confident that this translates to an honest and legitimate training program. I do not see enough third party, independent reviews of the program (actually next to none, another HUGE red flag) to feel confident sending money to them. Maybe that is enough of an answer right there.\n\nHas anyone heard of Suen or the Art of Crypto? Is this legit? Does anyone here have experience with this? Am I falling prey to a scam as old as time itself? Are there any actually legitimate trading training/education platforms or are they all just con artists?\n\nThanks yall.",

Started buying small amounts, few apps offering Btc for doing steps and other nonsense. Got my bonus and put it all in (as well as multiple shitcoins). Kept going up, invested more and more. It crashed, felt like I got swindled. Left a sour taste in my mouth. Sold at major loss. \n\nWas done with the whole crypto market. \n\nLate 2024 I started back. This time actually did my own research. Read bitcoin standard among others. Still hesitant. Bought back in around 94k (BTC only) weekly buys up to 125k and then back down to 90k. Still have my weekly buys. \n\nDIFFERENCE IS I HAVE NO ANXIETY. NO SOUR TASTE. \n\nWill keep doing my weekly buys and double if market is down. I don\u2019t plan on buying a lambo. I\u2019m planning on the future for my wife and kids. I have other hedge investments now, but I\u2019m steadily increasing my BTC position. Learn from those in this thread. Do you research. If BTC is down and fear is high, then strike. Feel free to @ me in 5 years if BTC is non existent \n",

Own the btc you self so they don't sell you shares of a btc and street out shares to being 2:1 or 3:1 so they can steal.. btc was created and will be 1:1 with in its self.

            "selftext": "I contend you can\u2019t have real faith in bitcoin until you\u2019ve lost your ass in one down cycle. I read the books. I thought I would hold no matter what but, eventually during the 2021 cycle I threw in the towel. I bought at 48,000 felt smart as it went up but I broke and threw in the towel at 20,000. Complete psychological dread. But after that, I realized it was all emotion and the fundamentals didn\u2019t change, I got back in at 31,000 and I honestly check the price maybe a couple times a week . I Lost 100k\u2026 but I\u2019m way back. so the reality is many of you will sell, and many of you will lose money. Some of you will come back, but until it\u2019s actually happened, you\u2019re gonna continue to check the sub and price every hour. So man up and ride the wave\u2026 the guys that went from 20,000 to 6000 were laughing their asses off in 2021 when all of us newbies were freaking the fuck out and selling bitcoin. Just hold turn off all the noise and get a different hobby for a while. End Rant - tough love but good advice if you take it.",

            "selftext": "In Brazil, a bank (Master) with over 1.5 million customers has just gone bankrupt due to corruption schemes, money laundering, and other crimes. The most downloaded app in the country right now is the FGC, a type of insurance fund that reimburses account holders up to a limit of about $50,000 if they had deposits or investments above that amount at the bank. In other words, if you had $200,000, you\u2019d receive only $50,000 from Brazil\u2019s Central Bank and absorb the rest of the loss. This is exactly why Bitcoin matters so much\u2014it\u2019s immune to situations like this. \n\n  \nSource: [https://www.reuters.com/business/brazils-central-bank-orders-extrajudicial-liquidation-banco-master-2025-11-18/](https://www.reuters.com/business/brazils-central-bank-orders-extrajudicial-liquidation-banco-master-2025-11-18/)",

            "selftext": "This video is about how government money printing took the American dream and turned it into a lifelong debt trap, and why \u200aBitcoin is becoming the only real way out. I break down the real reason housing is unaffordable and why the 50-year-mortgage is just the latest example of what a clown world fiat system truly is. When you print infinite money and let people borrow it to buy scarce things like housing, education, and healthcare, prices always explode. That\u2019s how the fiat system keeps you trapped in lifelong debt. But if you understand the game, you can opt out with Bitcoin.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I've been looking into Bitcoin and I sort of understand that it's a decentralized currency (eliminates the middle man/bank), there is a limited supply so it won't lose value like the dollar (still don't fully get the won't lose value due to the limited supply since \"value\" is tied to the dollar or other currencies), it settles faster than bank transactions, and it can't be taken from you. What I don't get is how all of those apply if you still need to sell it for dollars and transfer it to a bank to use it. Like I can't go pay my mortgage with it or go the store and buy groceries with it (outside of black market stuff, I don't know where else you can use it). Is the expectation that the entire world one day accept Bitcoin as payment?",

            "selftext": "Brazil is weighing a plan to extend its IOF financial transaction tax to crypto when it is used for cross border payments especially stablecoins. Right now crypto transactions are exempt from IOF even though the tax applies to things like foreign exchange credit and securities so regulators see this as a gap in the system.\n\nThe idea is simple\u2026 if you use USDT or USDC to move money abroad you should not get a better tax deal than people using the regular forex market. At the same time Brazil\u2019s central bank has approved rules that treat many stablecoin transactions and some wallet transfers as foreign exchange operations which pulls them into the same oversight as traditional FX.\n\nThis comes on top of a flat 17.5 percent tax on crypto capital gains which replaced the old progressive brackets and removed the monthly tax free threshold on smaller trades.\n\nOn the reporting side the Federal Revenue Service has said its new crypto reporting rules will follow the OECD\u2019s Crypto Asset Reporting Framework giving Brazilian authorities access to data on residents foreign crypto accounts once exchanges start sharing information. Brazil signed onto the CARF joint statement in late 2023 and has been building towards this since then.\n\nOther major jurisdictions are lining up too. The White House is currently reviewing an IRS and Treasury proposal to join CARF style reporting for US taxpayers foreign crypto accounts the EU has already built CARF into its DAC8 directive with first reports due from 2026 data and the UAE signed the CARF agreement in September 2025 with exchanges expected to start sharing data in 2028.\n\nBig picture\u2026 governments are steadily shutting down crypto tax loopholes and getting much better visibility into international flows. Using stablecoins to dodge taxes on cross border payments is likely to get harder from here not easier.\n\nAnd honestly, with everything getting more interconnected across countries, this is where tools built for multi-jurisdiction reporting actually matter. I use Awaken because it handles tax rules across different regions...including Brazil...so you don\u2019t have to re-build your cost basis and reporting logic every time one country updates its regulations. No tool fixes the tax laws, but having everything tracked cleanly at least keeps you from getting blindsided when rules like these kick in.",

Just wanted to get everyone else thoughts and see if there were any anecdotal evidence out there one way or the other? \n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Polygon enables Revolut users to move money across town or across borders with zero fees, and seamlessly on- and off-ramp\n\ntl;dr\n\n* Revolut users have processed more than $690 million in volume over Polygon\u00a0\n* Polygon provides Revolut low cost stablecoin transfers in crypto, while enabling users to pay, trade, and stake with POL\u00a0\n* Over 65 million users across 38 countries use Revolut (and 14 million crypto users), an enormous economic zone that showcases Polygon\u2019s real-world ability to scale to everyday demand\n* First phase of close collaboration with Polygon Labs is underway\n\nRevolut, Europe\u2019s largest neobank and one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing fintech platforms, has integrated with Polygon as its go-to stack for stablecoin transfers, payments, and trading. \n\nBy November 2025, over $690 million in volume has been processed over Polygon in the Revolut app, showing true adoption in the real-world by an avid user base.\n\nWith over 65 million users across 38 countries, Revolut\u2019s integration marks a pivotal moment, allowing users who opt-in to send and receive money via Polygon\u2019s rails seamlessly, without high-fees or the silo of borders. Native on- and off-ramps in the Revolut app ensure seamless user experience.\n\nIn the Revolut app, users can:\n\n* Send and receive stablecoins (USDC and USDT) over Polygon: With $3.5B and growing in stablecoin supply, Polygon is the go-to thoroughway for low cost stable transfers in crypto. Polygon unlocks the familiarity of traditional financial systems with the low-cost, fast-finality of web3.\u00a0\n* Pay using a Revolut crypto card: Revolut\u2019s in-app crypto card lets users pay for everyday purchases with stablecoins on Polygon\n* Trade and stake POL, the gas and staking token for Polygon: Users can directly stake or trade POL through the Revolut app\n* Zero-fee remittances: Gas costs on eligible transfers are covered, which means free transfers for users, and significant savings for cross-border remittances\n* Offramp to fiat directly within Revolut: Making global payments more seamless than ever\n\nThe first phase of this collaboration continues to see success.\u00a0\n\n# Revolut joins other enterprise solutions on Polygon\n\nRevolut\u2019s integration marks a major step in Web3 adoption, embedded directly into Revolut\u2019s existing app.\n\nAlready, Revolut has 14 million crypto users, demonstrating Polygon's readiness for mainstream financial services. The integration reinforces Polygon\u2019s lead as the go-to blockchain for enterprise payments and stablecoins.\u00a0\n\nRevolut joins other major institutions, enterprises, and governments selecting Polygon as crypto money rails, including:\u00a0\n\n* Stripe, with a majority of volume coming on Polygon and selecting Polygon as first choice for new developments, like recurring subscriptions\n* Flutterwave, Africa\u2019s leading cross-border money and payments infrastructure, selecting Polygon as the default chain\n* DeCard, enabling instant USDC and USDT0 payments 150M+ merchants globally, on Polygon\u00a0\n* As well as, Mastercard, WorldPay, Reliance Jio, NRW BANK and Cashlink, BlackRock and Securitize, , and many others integrating payments and RWAs\n\nPolygon brings stable, reliable, in-production blockchain rails to global institutions, supporting millions of transactions daily with an average transaction fee of fractions of a penny.\n\nRevolut\u2019s integration with Polygon comes on the heels of the network\u2019s most important payments-focused upgrade yet. The Rio upgrade for payments made Polygon faster, lighter, and more reliable, enabling 5,000 transactions per second with near-instant finality and eliminating the risk of reorgs. This means Revolut users, and millions more to come, can move money on rails that settle as fast as messages, cementing Polygon as the go-to blockchain for global payments.\n\nRevolut x Polygon sets the stage for more collaborations in cross-border payments, remittances, and the broader convergence of traditional and decentralized finance.\n\n",

At a time when the market is drowning in fear, ETF outflows, and shaky macro signals\u2026 this forecast feels like it dropped from another dimension. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nIf that target plays out, Bitcoin would need to more than double from current levels - a 126% explosion in barely six weeks.

OpenAI looks like it would exceed the 51% hashrate for both of the above coins with their current ~1 million GPUs.  Keep in mind I am only using some quick math in Grok to do the calculations. \n\nI know there are only a select few companies that currently have this compute and the use of those GPUs is probably highly controlled, but I imagine there will be many more large AI companies shortly and who knows what hacking group or malware group might try to get access to what is essentially a giant network of GPUs",

It means that it is the most logical point, in which various factors converge (cyclical analyses, on-chain analyses, liquidity pressure);\n\n3) Analysts are NOT infallible, many have different schools of thought, as happens with any non-exact science. Even in medicine there are various schools of thought, but this does not mean that doctors are useless;\n\n4) Breaking that support leads directly to significantly lower support at $63K.\n\nTo date, therefore, considering all aspects, $73-75 K is the highest shared value.\nAfterwards, whether it stays at 89-90 to rise to 200 or whether it drops to 50, no one can say with certainty, but if you want to read with a sense what happens in finance, above 75 (and the further away you go) it is overpaid, below 73 it is undervalued (as established by the analysis of the asset).\n\nI hope this is clearer.",

            "selftext": "At 5:00 AM Beijing time (5:00 PM Eastern), buy orders on Binance began to be massively withdrawn.  \nBitcoin and altcoins entered a 20-minute free fall \u2014 the entire Binance order book collapsed.  \nThe issue was not that the whole market lacked buyers.  \nThe question is: **why did only Binance\u2019s buy orders disappear?**  \nBinance\u2019s buy-side depth was significantly lower than other exchanges.\n\nIn traditional markets (like NASDAQ or other U.S. stock exchanges), such a \u201cvacuum\u201d is almost impossible \u2014 and certainly not isolated to a single venue.\n\n**1. The Strongest Evidence Available Online (Data Acquisition Authenticity Screen-Recorded)**\n\n  \nBelow is BTC/USDT perpetual futures order book data **a few hours before the incident**.  \n  The green line represents bids, the red line represents asks \u2014 a symmetrical structure with bids decreasing and asks increasing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5cexwd3v02g1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=889447ace0c4e0db2006acbce44f9639de658018\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dflbkcv9v02g1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=91c02fa7b8ba9871196827467b599c8aa7228dce\n\nAround **4:55**, a small portion of bids exceeded asks, but there was still sufficient buying depth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9ueiiugv02g1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe64bc8deedb53c1c461290092006f6d62dbfdb\n\n\n\nBy By **5:10**, the bids and asks visibly crossed \u2014 a prolonged crossed market, signaling matching engine failure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3s9vrrkv02g1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=52abac7c28a9e9d84fae4bb833c9357360f2f7b3\n\nAround **5:20**, which marked the lowest prices across many coins, altcoin bids fell into a complete vacuum.  \n  It\u2019s estimated that **most matching shards were entirely frozen**.  \n   \nBoth the **Order Ingress Queue** and **matching queue** were heavily congested.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hol53hsv02g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=d879dd50dc18a16b80291981c3f6c838f1f44bbc\n\n**The engine could not process incoming orders in time.**  \n Binance\u2019s core trading system suffered a severe breakdown.  \n In short: old bids were withdrawn, new bids couldn\u2019t enter \u2014 prices went   into free fall.  \n\n\n**2. Major Market Makers' Cross-Exchange Trading Locked Down\u2014Twilight of the Gods**\n\nAfter buy-side liquidity vanished, major market makers who should have been obligated to provide quotes and support the market faced cross-exchange trading difficulties due to Binance's withdrawal congestion. Market makers like Wintermute, with priority channels and high-speed order placement capabilities, can normally execute even during extreme conditions when the matching engine is overloaded. However, their liquidity is limited. After Binance's order book issues caused price crashes, Wintermute's CEO described being unable to withdraw coins purchased on Binance to sell on Coinbase\u2014preventing them from obtaining funds to redeposit on Binance to maintain buy-side support.\n\nFor example, DOGE fell to $0.095 on Binance, while it was $0.17 on Coinbase at the same time.  \n    \nIf Binance hadn't experienced various technical issues, would a \"buy-side vacuum\" really occur? The answer is clearly no. Consider normal market conditions: when Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 BTC, Bitcoin dropped from $118,000 to $115,000. On October 11, with no major on-chain anomalies detected, Bitcoin plummeted from $117,000 to $101,500 in 30 minutes.  \n  The market's strong buying pressure with nowhere to go was also reflected in the options market\u2014   \n   \n\\- Almost all sell-side liquidity disappeared in the options market; -  \n   \n  Option buy orders continued stacking up, with actual transaction prices far exceeding fair values calculated by the Black-Scholes model.   \n\\- Orders were mostly from professional quantitative institutions; whenever someone posted a remotely reasonable sell price, it was immediately swept by bots.\n\nIn other words, people wanting to buy never truly disappeared\u2014they simply couldn't buy due to various technical reasons. \u3002 If you could buy ATOM at $0.0001, wouldn't you? Obviously you would. Now let's examine the situation for ordinary quant firms and retail traders at the bottom of the food chain.\n\n\n\n**3\u3001 Quants and Retail Wiped Out Without Priority Exchange Access**\n\nDuring this trading anomaly, without access to low-latency matching channels, quant traders and retail investors were completely locked out of the system.  \n   \nMultiple market maker friends reported experiencing hundreds of order retry attempts during the incident. Even ReduceOnly orders (the highest system priority for position reduction) couldn't execute, continuously encountering 503 (Service Unavailable) and -1008 (Service Overloaded) errors\u2014all fully logged. ReduceOnly orders failed to go through; Taker and Maker orders had even less chance.. Bottom-fishing buy orders were universally rejected.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkcgf9w9w02g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7454ee08c0e52a85c6c87ee1f487744ac42f02f\n\nIn the end, retail traders\u2014who understood the underlying truth least and created no pressure on the overloaded system\u2014were labeled \"gamblers\" and bore the greatest losses. Their margin was carved up by counterparties and the exchange.\n\n  \n**4\u3001 Collapse of Fake Liquidity**\n\nDoes Binance engage in wash trading?  \n  My answer: 100% yes.  \n   \nEspecially among altcoins that crashed to near-zero during the 10\u00b711 incident \u2014 such as ATOM .  \n  How can a top-50 coin, worth over 1.5b usd go to zero in minutes?\n\nArtificial liquidity made the market look vibrant \u2014 fake depth lured users into an illusion.  \n  But once the matching engine faltered, this fake liquidity collapsed into vacuum\n\n\n\n**5\u3001 Comparison with Fair, Regulated Markets**\n\nAre Binance's market makers actually Binance itself? Does Binance still control a market maker like Sigma Chain\u2014as the SEC once alleged? Was the buy order withdrawal purely a system malfunction or intentional by Binance? I cannot verify this.\n\nBut regardless, market making should follow basic rules.\n\nIn traditional markets like NASDAQ, market maker regulations are extremely strict. Take Rules 4613 and 4619 as examples:\n\n* Market makers must continuously provide two-sided quotes\n* Quote depth and spread (Maximum Allowable Spread) have clear limits\n* If withdrawing due to technical or legal reasons, must apply for \"Excused Withdrawal\"\n* Unexcused Withdrawal results in penalties or delisting\n\nWash Trading is strictly prohibited, with clear role separation between market makers and exchanges. Under such reasonable and fair frameworks, a \"sudden buy-side vacuum\" without major news or concentrated selling pressure is virtually impossible.\n\nBecause a stable closed loop forms between the exchange, users, and market makers.\n\nIn Binance's regulatory vacuum, the situation is completely opposite: Frequent API errors, severely imbalanced order books, and it's unknown whether user funds are being misappropriated to manipulate market prices. There's extreme incentive misalignment between the outsourced teams maintaining the trading system and the exchange. Do they have sufficient motivation to ensure smooth operation of a system generating $70 million in matching fees daily?\n\n\n\n**6\u3001 The Universe's #1 Exchange in a Regulatory Vacuum**\n\nIn this incident:\n\n* Long position holders were liquidated\n* Short position holders (e.g., \"delta neutral\" strategies\u2014buying spot, selling futures) were forcibly auto-deleveraged (ADL) at absurd prices and liquidated at completely unreasonable prices\u2014exactly as Wintermute's CEO described.\n\nThey weren't blind gamblers, yet became sacrifices for Binance's hundred-billion-dollar valuation.\n\nIn a market with virtually no regulatory constraints, when an exchange permits such buy-side vacuums, it's no longer intermediating between buyers and sellers\u2014it's directly counter-trading with users. And users always lose.\n\n  \n**7\u3001 Public Request for Evidence**\n\nWe request Binance submit a \"platform-level minimal proof package\" (unrelated to any individual account) by October 31\uff1a\n\n1\uff09 Pricing/Mark Price/Price Bands\n\nMark price per second + algorithm version\n\nIndex components/weights/clipping logs (full data for those minutes)\n\nPrice bands (upper/lower) per second + \"out-of-band rejection volume\" per second + manual intervention status\n\n2\uff09Liquidation/ADL (System Level)\n\nLiquidation/ADL order volume and notional, queue length, matching resource allocation (per second)\n\nRisk engine version and parameter changes (event window \u00b11 hour): MMR tables, ADL rules, change logs\n\n3\uff09Insurance Fund\n\nBalance and transactions (per second, including accounts/counterparties)\n\nFunding gaps and disposal priorities (capital injection/suspension/call auction/price band adjustment)\n\n4\uff09Matching Neutrality / Proprietary Net Selling\n\n\"No Proprietary Net Selling Statement\" + Merkle root of proprietary/affiliated account set\n\nProprietary net Delta and market-making net Delta per-second summary during event window (fields may be anonymized)\n\n5\uff09Operations and Change Control\n\nEvent window \u00b11 hour: \"freeze/approval records\" and version hashes for parameters/code/rate limit thresholds\n\nOverall platform health: p50/p95 latency, error rate, availability per second; call auction/circuit breaker trigger records\n\n\n\nThe truth grows clearer through debate.  \n  If you are a **whistleblower** or possess **key evidence**, please step forward to help uncover the truth, Thank you!  \n  \n",

            "selftext": "Mastercard, Polygon Labs, and Mercuryo are bringing verified, alias-based identities to self-custody wallets, simplifying crypto transfers and advancing the next generation of global payments\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n* Mastercard Crypto Credential is expanding to self-custody wallets, replacing long wallet addresses with verified, username-style aliases.\n* Polygon is the first blockchain network to natively support this functionality, chosen for its speed, reliability, and payments-focused architecture.\n* Mercuryo will onboard verified users and issue credentials, while Polygon provides the instant, low-cost infrastructure required for global-scale identity and payments.\n* Together, this brings self-custody into the mainstream: intuitive UX, trusted verification\n\nMastercard is expanding Mastercard Crypto Credential to self-custody wallets, selecting Polygon as the first blockchain network to support the rollout. Working with Mercuryo, the initial issuer onboarding verified users, the companies are introducing verified, username-based transfers that replace long wallet addresses with simple aliases.\n\nThe expansion brings a trusted verification layer directly to self-custody, giving users a familiar way to send and receive assets while keeping full control of their wallets.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a major step toward making self-custody intuitive, secure, and ready for global-scale payments.\n\n# Verified identities meet user-controlled wallets\n\nMastercard Crypto Credential replaces complex addresses with verified user names: human-readable identifiers that map to a user\u2019s wallet. Mercuryo handles KYC onboarding and issuance, ensuring that aliases correspond to real, verified individuals.\n\nOnce verified, users can:\n\n* Link a self-custody wallet to a username-style alias\n* Receive assets using only that alias\n* Opt in to a soulbound credential on Polygon signaling their verified status across the Crypto Credential network\n\nThe result is a user-controlled wallet with a trusted, portable verification layer, without requiring users to give up custody, privacy, or flexibility.\n\nIt\u2019s a UX breakthrough: the simplicity of traditional payments with the self-custody of crypto.\n\n# A simple flow that feels like the internet\n\nExpanding Crypto Credential to self-custody unlocks a clean, universal user experience:\n\n1. Verify once with Mercuryo\n2. Get a username-style alias tied to your identity\n3. Link your self-custody wallet\n4. Optionally mint a soulbound credential signaling verification onchain\n5. Receive crypto via your alias (sending functionality next)\n\nNo more triple-checking hex strings. No more sending a test transaction and praying. Just a familiar flow users already understand.\n\nThis is a major shift in how people interact with blockchain. When verification becomes portable and UX becomes friendly, self-custody stops being a niche skill and starts becoming a default option.\n\n# Why Mastercard chose Polygon\n\nCrypto Credential requires infrastructure that behaves like a global payments network. That means:\n\n* Ease of integration for institutions\n* Reliability & trusted enterprise adoption\n* Sub-cent fees\n* Fast, predictable settlement\n* High throughput under real-world load\n* No reorg risk\n\nPolygon delivers exactly that.\n\nWith the recent Rio upgrade, the network eliminated the risk of reorgs and introduced stateless validation, lowering node costs to make building on Polygon easier than ever before. Combined with the Heimdall v2 consensus upgrade and higher throughput (with 5k TPS coming in the next few months), Polygon achieves near-instant finality, bringing faster settlement times than traditional payments systems.\n\nBillions in stablecoins already move across Polygon monthly, with neobanks, fintechs, and enterprise payment providers relying on the network for speed and reliability. Adding Mastercard Crypto Credential to self-custody workflows is a natural extension of this momentum.\n\nFor institutions, reliability is the differentiator. Polygon\u2019s architecture ensures transfers are final, fast, and cost-efficient, enabling credential verification flows to scale globally.\n\n# Adoption drives scale. Scale drives simplicity.\n\nMastercard\u2019s expansion onto Polygon is another signal in a broader pattern: global payments infrastructure is moving onchain, and Polygon is leading\n\nWhen money builders think about payments, they think about:\n\n* Reliability\n* Trust\n* Finality\n* Throughput\n* Cost efficiency\n\nEvery upgrade to Polygon is designed to enshrine these demands. Credential verification flows, high-frequency transfers, user onboarding, remittances, merchant payouts, and agentic payments all need a network that behaves like the internet.\n\nOn Polygon, they get it.\n\n# Build payments on Polygon\n\nWhether you\u2019re designing wallets, onboarding flows, identity layers, or full-scale payment applications, Polygon provides the speed, reliability, and real-world integrations to support global users.",

            "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI\u2019m looking to buy a Bitcoin-tracking ETF. Outside Europe, especially in the US, it\u2019s easy to find highly liquid and well-structured products, but in Europe it seems much more complicated due to regulation.\n\nFrom what I understand, these instruments are technically ETPs rather than ETFs.\n\nHere are the criteria I\u2019m looking for:\n\n\u2022\u00a0**Available to EU residents**\u00a0(for example, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT is not)\n\n\u2022\u00a0**Very low fees**\u00a0(ideally around 0.15%, with a maximum of 0.25% per year)\n\n\u2022\u00a0**High-quality replication**\u00a0of the underlying asset.\n\n\u2022\u00a0**Large AUM and strong liquidity**, so I can sell a few hundred thousand dollars in a single trade without moving the market\n\nI\u2019ve seen many products, but most are either not in USD or have very low market caps. On paper, the following ones look acceptable:\n\n\u2022\u00a0**CoinShares Physical Bitcoin (BITCUSD)**\u00a0\u2014 SIX Switzerland, 0.25% fee, 1.5B AUM\n\n\u2022\u00a0**WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin (BTCWUSD)**\u00a0\u2014 SIX Switzerland, 0.15% fee, 1.1B AUM\n\n\u2022\u00a0**iShares Bitcoin ETP (BTCN)**\u00a0\u2014 AEB Netherlands, 0.15% fee, 548M AUM\n\n\u2022\u00a0**21Shares Bitcoin Core ETP (CBTCUSD)**\u00a0\u2014 SIX Switzerland, 0.10% fee, 385M AUM\n\n\u2022\u00a0**Invesco Physical Bitcoin (BTIC)**\u00a0\u2014 SIX Switzerland, 0.10% fee, 334M AUM\n\nOther products exist, but they\u2019re either too expensive or have very small AUM.\n\nOn paper these ETPs seem fine, but I\u2019ve seen that some of them can have huge spreads between the buying and selling price.\n\nHas anyone here traded them through IBKR or any serious brokers in Europe?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate feedback on liquidity for the USD versions so I can choose the right one.",

Despite challenging rainy-season roads, the service continues, offering rides where possible and introducing locals to BCH payments.\n\nAt the end of November and beginning of December, the first CHAPA BCH Mozambique meetup will take place. Attendees will:\n\n- Learn how to use BCH in daily life\n\n- Get help installing wallets and making their first transaction\n\n- Receive guides and educational materials\n\n- Build a local support network for BCH adoption\n\n\nThis initiative is 100% community-funded, aiming to grow BCH usage in Maputo and Matola. Every ride, every participant, and every merchant involved helps expand real-world adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\n\nIf you want to support the movement, optional BCH contributions go directly to running the project, educational materials, and future meetups:\nBCH Address: bitcoincash:qrkqjm9r8r4tlju42zpw4p9ecnedy9ue75f6dxwl98\n\nRead the full blog and learn more about the project here: https://read.cash/@alberdioni8406/introducing-the-chapa-bch-meetup-a-hands-on-guide-to-using-bitcoin-cash-fc03609f",

What many fail to understand is this, BItcoin always recovers so zoom out of the chart to have a clear view of the market. I often wonder if ETF was a blessing to us due to large institutional manipulation of the market. Imagine blackrock selling hard and who knows if other might be responsible for this current correction but for sure this is a good time to buy the dip rather than panic selling. What do you think?",

            "selftext": "This being my second cycle (I \"discovered\" crypto in January 2021), I'm confused by the sentiment of fear surrounding a predictable cycle correction. There are so many clich\u00e9s with crypto, that ring true: \"Time in market, beats timing the market\", \"Don't catch falling knives\", \"DCA in,  DCA out\", \"Don't invest more than your willing to lose\" and the list goes on. This cycle is acting very similar to the last one, and even had the implied missing ALT season, if you were lucky (good) enough to catch the right ones. As any asset matures, the peaks and valleys become less pronounced.\n\nHistorically Bitcoin peaks 13 - 18 months post halving. That's been the case for the past 3 cycles. Meaning, if halving was April 2024 (it was), then the cycle top should be anywhere between May and October 2025.\n\nOf course, to throw in another clich\u00e9, no one knows shit about fuck. But if there's one thing that I learned from the first cycle, take your profits and don't get caught holding the bag. Unless you're planning to long term hodl, in which case corrections are irrelevant. I spent the previous bear market, researching, watching charts, learning and accumulating. The bull is fun, but the bear is where you make money. Because *anything* is still possible, there still may be another leg up, and if so, I hope your bags overflow.",

It's a game where you can practice trading cryptos (like LINK, BTC, ETH, etc.) using real historical charts, but in a fast-forwarded way.\n\nIt's not a typical paper-trading simulator but more like a \"trading gym\". You get random setups, make your call (Long or Short), and then fast-forward time to see how it plays out in seconds. Idea is that the skill comes from reps(hence the \"gym\").\n\nCurrent features include:\n\n* Practice with crypto and stock charts on real price data\n* Fast-forward through days of price action in minutes\n* Earn rating and climb leaderboards\n\nNo signup or login required.\n\nI'll drop the link in the comments if anyone's interested in sharing their thoughts.",

I want to store my altcoin on one or several wallets which I want to keep on a usb stick.\nWhich wallet is the most user friendly but still safe? I\u2019m looking at exodus wallet. It\u2019s important I need a wallet that doesn\u2019t require KYC.\n\nIs there a tutorial for this kinda thing? For now I\u2019m investing in dogecoin, litecoin, NEAR. Later ethereum, some BNB, Tron.\n\nMy bitcoin I will store on a TAILS usb stick which has an electrum cold wallet.",

This is no longer the case as bitcoin has matured. Bitcoin is now a much harder market to move and the halving supply reduction is insignificant.\n\nThe post halving bull and bear was fun while it lasted but bitcoin is now following larger macro factors.\n\nThe fear behind the four year cycle ending will cause a lot of selling for no other reason than fear, and institutions will take advantage of this. But once the weak hands sell their stack out of fear hoping to buy back lower thats when the market will run higher leaving them behind forever.\n\nThinking the four year cycle will play out the way it has done in the past just because it has happened in the past a few times before is nonsensicle. Every trader knows the second everyone believes in a pattern thats the second the pattern breaks. \n\nThe four year cycle no longer exists but very few people realise this yet.\n\nIn the comments watch how many people will defend the four year cycle. When everyone expects something to happen it rarely does.\n",

            "selftext": "bitcoin does not magically go up in price as fiat supply grows and the same is said when the money supply contracts. Bitcoin does not work this way. \n\nPeople (I\u2019m people) like to say Bitcoin is currently acting as a store of value but some also seem to misunderstand that this doesn\u2019t guarantee the price of a bitcoin. \n\n**What actually matters is demand.** Unlike anything else in history we know what the supply of bitcoins will be. Exactly like everything else in history we **do not know** what the demand will be. \n\nAll we can do is assume others will eventually learn to understand why Bitcoin is so important and we can assume this will drive up demand for bitcoins. \n\nIn the past we have seen the \u201cfour year cycle\u201d or self fulfilling prophecy come true. But this is not some magical anomaly. It is people believing the prophecy and following it; instead of DCA into the network people are selling out of it. This causes the price of bitcoin to fall relative to other assets and currency. \n\nJust wanted to remind everyone of these things during this downturn. You can\u2019t predict human nature with accuracy but you can verify the supply of bitcoin. \n\nWith all that said, every single bear market has *coincidentally* front run a stock market correction. Every single stock market correction has front run a negative macroeconomic event (QT, major uncertainty, fear, etc). \n\nThis time is somewhat different from a macro perspective. The current fear is an AI bubble and the uncertainty is the Trump administration but rates are being cut and the \u201cmoney printer\u201d is almost certainly going into full swing. They will print their way out of this and that money will have to go somewhere. \n\nMy fear is that the majority will get burned in the AI industry in hopes of solving AGI. My hope is that this doesn\u2019t lead to a 2008 type crash. \n\nTLDR; if you want to contribute to the decline of bitcoin, sell. If you\u2019re scared and uncertain of the future, hold. If you understand how our financial system works, stay employed, buy, and diversify. Nothing is guaranteed other than 21M bitcoins. \n",

You can see those people, always complaining, always spelling doom and gloom.\n\nBitcoin is being announced dead, which has already happened hundreds of times throughout its history.\n\nAnd just like during previous years, this time, people once again are convinced it's over. And those who hate it are cheering. Little do they know, BTC will one day reach 1M, 1B, etc...\n\nMost people just can't learn the cycle and pattern, so they always focus on the short-term.

This is not a get rich quick scheme. If you have some extra money and want to invest in bitcoin please do. Please stop shorting it using leveraging, etc. You want to invest put some money there Don\u2019t think about it. Come back in four years and see how you\u2019re doing. But let\u2019s stop putting our life savings or everything we have into it and expecting us to get rich quick. You realize that the people that have made all the money have been holding onto it for a decade or more . Then we won\u2019t have these constant conversations on Reddit about bitcoin dropping below 90 K and people freaking out! If you can freak out about that, then that\u2019s not the right investment for you. Put some money and hold see what happens. Please do not put everything you have into bitcoin or any investment.\nI got in late, but I got it at the last dip at 16 K so I\u2019m doing fine but I only put what I had to lose into it. Please do the same. ",

Each bar aggregates realized profit and loss from spent outputs in that time slice, so you can see when spending is dominated by wins vs. cuts.\n* **Bottom panel:** age-band activity split into 100 distinct UTXO age groups, spaced logarithmically. That means very young coins are in fine-grained buckets on the left, and the buckets gradually widen as you move out toward multi-year holders.\n\nTogether, the charts show which parts of the holder base are actually moving coins... short-term vs. mid-term vs. older UTXOs... without making any claim about direction or \u201csignal,\u201d just a structural look at how realized PnL and coin ages are behaving on-chain.",

These purchases are made from collections selected by the team, with the acquired NFTs later distributed as rewards to eligible platform users. All transactions are executed publicly onchain.\n\nYesterday, while conducting its scheduled buys, a member of OpenSea\u2019s team executed a sweep on Base using an incorrect contract address. Approximately 4 ETH was spent acquiring NFTs from a counterfeit BadBunnz collection instead of the legitimate collection.\n\nOpenSea Chief Marketing Officer Adam Hollander issued the following statement shortly after the incident:\n\n\u201ca member of our team made a mistake when executing our purchasing this morning.  \nthe full amount will be replenished from opensea; it will not affect the reward pool.  \neveryone makes mistakes, our team members are human.  \nthe fake collection has of course been removed.\u201d\n\nThe erroneous purchases have been confirmed as coming from OpenSea\u2019s rewards wallet. The counterfeit collection has since been delisted from the platform, and the company has stated that the incident will have no no impact on the ongoing rewards program or the intended support for the authentic BadBunnz project..\n\nIn an industry built on permissionless & trustless tech, even the largest marketplace just paid 4 ETH to remind us all: don't trust, verify.",

I tried OKX, but it seems I can't apply for a debit card since there's no option available, even after completing KYC. I believe Nexo might also cease offering services to EU citizens soon, as regulators are tightening restrictions. So, I really need advice on where I can get a debit card to spend USDC. Does anyone have any suggestions or known working solutions? Crypto.com is not an option for me, and I do not want to do it via Revolut as well because I do not want to mess up my account. ",

Maybe this momentum will continu and you will have to wait a couple of years for gains, or maybe your invested projects will fail, one thing is certain and that is that time will tell.. \n\nDo use this moment to gain a lower average and learn about the market. Don't panic, if you used money you are willing to lose just let it ride. It might take some time, but there are more important things in life. Just remember to enjoy time with your loved ones and have some fun! \n\nGoodluck to everyone out there and stay safe :) \n",

            "selftext": "All the noise from people keep saying that the next bear market will be a cute little dip. That we would go into \"stocks like environment\" where we see smaller dips, but also smaller gains in coming bulls.\n\nNope.\n\n2026 is shaping up to be the most violent unwinding this space has ever experienced, and almost nobody is ready for it, as the general consensus from retail is the opposite atm.\n\nLet me explain why.  \n\n\n**1. Institutions don\u2019t hodl. They sell. And HARD they will sell.**\n\nThis cycle was the first time Bitcoin became a truly real institutional asset. Sounds bullish on paper, but the reality no one wants to talk about: institutions are forced sellers during recessions.\n\nThey de risk into cash.\n\nThey have clients to protect, redemptions to satisfy and risk rules to follow.\n\nThey are not your diamond handed Twitter influencers or average crypto bro from Reddit.\n\nWhen liquidity dries up, they don\u2019t wait for hopium. They hit the sell button.  \n\n\n**2. The MicroStrategy situation is a ticking bomb. BOMB**. **The \"Tsar bomba\" kind of a bomb.**\n\nEveryone treats MSTR like some \u201csavior of Bitcoin\u201d, but it is basically a publicly traded giga leveraged long BTC position. They have billions in debt and BTC as collateral. If BTC drops -40 to -50%, which it likely will, they get squeezed harder than crypto  gif memes.\n\nIf MSTR starts getting margin pressure or forced collateral adjustments, then the selling pressure will be worse than 3AC, Celsius and Terra combined. We will se a huge black swan event, similar or wose than the FTX event. However, this can be magnificant for retail to entry at low prices.   \n\n\n**3. ETF flows do not just go up.**\n\nYes. We had the first ETF driven bull run ever. But know what? That will follow with the first ETF driven bear run. If there is a recession or just a risk off macro period, ETF outflows will be brutal. Financial advisors will rotate clients into safer assets. Pension funds will reduce risk exposure. Family offices will trim BTC like any other volatile asset. When the lights go off for good (already starting), ETF outflows mean instant sell pressure that retail is not ready for.  \n\n\n**4. Corporate treasuries might have to dump too.**\n\nCompanies holding BTC look cool in a bull run, but when earnings weaken and credit conditions tighten.. Yeah, time to buckle up and say cya. It's natural for boards to tell them to cut risk. Auditors push impairment accounting. Cash becomes the thing again. Corporate selling has not been tested in a real macro downturn. 2026 WILL LIKELY be the first time.  \n\n\n**5. Leverage in this market is insane compared to previous cycles.**\n\nThe amount of perpetuals, options, structured BTC notes and corporate debt collateralized by BTC is ridiculous. When all of that unwinds under macro stress, it won\u2019t be a small minus -30% dip. It will be a face melting liquidity vacuum.  \n\n\n**6. QE will not save you early. It arrives after the pain.**\n\nLast but not least. Most people embrace the hopium of QE starting in 2026. Yes. Probably and actually, likely. But only after the market collapses. Q1-Q2 will be brutal. It will be enough time for the charts to plummet so hard it will go beneath your screen's bottom corner. Yes, after that will likely come QE, but why hold through that when one can sell now and double their position soon?\n\nThe next crash will not be (only) a retail emotional panic.\n\nIt will be an institutional, corporate, leverage driven purge.\n\n\n\nBTC survives. ETH probably survives. SOL might survive but bleed badly. Most altcoins will die and never come back. Many of the TOP 20 and even TOP 50 alts are already down -60% to -80% of their ATH prices. ADA going $0,02 or ALGO below $0,5 or ETH below $1000 are not unlikely scenarios. Some will drop even a lot more. Many big alts will be f\\*\\*d up so hard even their mother will not recognitze them.\n\nSo what I'm kinda trying to say.. If you think 2022 was bad, 2026 is going to surprise you.\n\nNot financial advice, btw.\n\nJust a warning from someone who finally stopped drinking hopium and started looking at the actual market structure we created.",

If bitcoin Reddit, and all your other crypto related apps are consuming more than 3 hours a day at the MOST congratulations you have an addiction. \n\nIf you find yourself staring and swiping down in real time to see how your crypto is moving, you have an addiction. \n\nTHAT is not INVESTING if you are doing the above. It is GAMBLING. Why? Investors play the long game and understand it will fluctuate. They don\u2019t stress it and have invested what they can afford to lose.\n\nGAMBLERS however aren\u2019t calm, their livelihood is on the line, so they are ANXIOUS. They PANIC. They put money for bills in crypto hoping to make money but now the bills are due and panic because if they sell for a loss they have less money than they started with for bills.\n\nWhich camp are you in? If you fall under the gambler it is time to reconsider your strategy because your strategy is just RISKING money not INVESTING.",

            "selftext": "Hey all, looking for some feedback on my new business!\n\nEarlier this year I was thinking of potential birthday gifts for my 1-year-old nephew and jokingly said I wish just got given a load of bitcoin when I was younger. \u00a0\n\nHowever, while I considered this as a gift I didn\u2019t feel like there was a fun way to actually gift bitcoin that included a physical element to it.\n\nThat\u2019s when I came up with the idea of the \u2018Bitcoin Bear\u2019, a teddy bear that contains bitcoin until a set unlock date!\n\nI tested the idea with a few friends down the pub and decided that this might actually have some legs to it. In my evenings I\u2019ve now built up a full website, built the back end, ordered in the first 100 bears and started to market to family / friends.\n\nThe concept is that people can choose how much bitcoin they load the bear with and can scan the QR code on the back of the bear to check the balance at any time.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest the solution is very much MVP and I expect it to raise a few eyebrows on here but also don\u2019t want to sink too much time and money into something until I can prove the concept.\n\nCurrently I hold a pooled wallet and release the bitcoin manually on unlock date. I know I need to make the custody more robust in the long term but feel like this gives me a good starting point for the first 100 bears and did just start as me creating something for my own nephew!\n\nI\u2019d be really keen to share what I\u2019ve built and get some feedback from fellow bitcoiners on:\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The concept itself (would you gift it?!)\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The website, branding and user journey\n\nc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any thoughts on longer term custody model and ways to build trust\n\nOpen to all thoughts and feedback! The website is [www.cryptocuddlies.com](http://www.cryptocuddlies.com)\n\nThanks in advance\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49rwfvye1v1g1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5f6e465b2f2962ee37aba5eb35f9ac8074d5fb2\n\n",

We don't have any data for btc behavior and substantial mining rewards.\n3. Rising China. We've never been this close to a multi-polar world. We dont know what effect that will have, if any.\n4. AI. In previous cycles crypto was the shiny new thing but now AI has arguably sucked tremendous amount of capital and attention away from that. We dont know what effect that is having if any.\n\n\nSample size problems abound. Things have changed and we dont know which rules will continue to apply and which won't.

            "selftext": "The idea of a Digital Asset Treasury, or DAT, is becoming one of the most credible ways for tokens to create long term value. Instead of relying on hype cycles or inflationary supply models, a DAT ties a token to real revenue, real accumulation, and a clear economic framework.\n\nBONK\u2019s DAT is managed by Safety Shot, a publicly traded company. Safety Shot is the first public company to hold a memecoin as part of a formal treasury strategy. They currently hold about 2.75 percent of BONK\u2019s total supply and are actively growing toward a stated goal of 5 percent. Safety Shot receives 10 percent of revenue from BONKfun, and roughly 90 percent of that revenue is used for open market BONK accumulation.\n\nThis setup is unusual in the memecoin sector for three reasons.\n\n  \nFirst, BONK has an external buyer that is funded by product usage. As BONKfun grows, so does the revenue. As revenue grows, the DAT buys more BONK. This creates predictable demand that is linked directly to onchain activity.\n\n  \nSecond, Safety Shot is a public company. Public reporting requirements create stability and transparency that most memecoins do not have.\n\n  \nThird, it introduces a clear model for how cultural tokens can evolve. A memecoin with a revenue generating ecosystem and a corporate treasury that accumulates supply is fundamentally different from a token that relies on speculation alone.\n\nMost memecoins do not have a buyer of last resort, a recurring revenue source, or a structured treasury. BONK now has all three.\n\nFor a category that has historically struggled with durability, BONK\u2019s Digital Asset Treasury with Safety Shot may be one of the clearest paths toward a sustainable, long term memecoin economy.",

And a new crypto Keeta has Max Theoretical TPS of 10,000,000. I'm just wondering how important is TPS? and in what ways does it affect the crypto price? [Data source website here](https://chainspect.app/dashboard).\n\nAlso what is the real life demand for TPS? Even though Solana has a Max Theoretical TPS of 65k, the real time TPS is only 1,000. Visa is only processing 4,000 TPS at peak hours from a post 8 years ago [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/82438o/visa_is_capable_of_performing_24000_transactions/). So is there even a need for things like 10M TPS?\n\nThank you.",

            "selftext": "Here's a table of BTC cycles so far and what we could expect for the next low:\n\n|Inflection|Date|Days|Price|Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|High|11/30/13||1,127||\n|Low|1/14/15|410|172|\\-85%|\n|High|12/16/17|1,067|19,665|\\+11,324%|\n|Low|12/17/18|366|3,217|\\-84%|\n|High|11/9/21|1,058|67,617|\\+2,002%|\n|Low|11/10/22|366|15,742|\\-77%|\n|High|10/7/25|1,062|124,774|\\+693%|\n|Low|*10/8/26?*|*366?*|*37,400?*|*-70%?*|\n\nAs you can see, the four year cycles have been very consistent, with very close to the same number of days between inflection points. Each cycle has had diminishing returns, with significantly lower gains in the bull periods and slightly reduced losses in the bear periods.\n\nBased on this pattern we should expect BTC to be under $40K in October 2026, though of course there will be a choppy ride to get there.\n\nSome of the main reasons reality could turn out differently than this forecast:\n\n1. **We don't see reduced losses.**\u00a0I'm assuming the -77% we experienced in the last bear is part of a trend of reduced losses, implying about 70% drawdown this cycle. The low will be $22,500 if we see the historical average 82% drawdown.\n2. **Bear markets for stocks / recession.**\u00a0Since inception BTC has only existed during a historically positive bull market for US equities, with the exception of the COVID blip. A prolonged stock market bear or recession will probably result in a lower low than the table above.\n3. **Trump administration intervention.**\u00a0Trump and his circle are heavily exposed to crypto prices, and could try to intervene to keep prices from falling too much. This could result in a higher low than the four year cycle would predict.\n4. **The four year cycle is dead.**\u00a0There are a number of reasons this could be the case, and a predictable pattern can't last forever. For now it seems to be self fulfilling and very consistent so until the pattern breaks I'd be very careful betting against it.",

I just wanted to buy $BTC and forget, but buying $2k felt lame, so I tried memecoins. \n\nI got lucky, and I saw this coin being called somewhere. Please don't buy now, very high risk!! \n\nI bought some first, 2xed, it went low, I bought again, and here I am with $11k in my account.\n\nNow I am here because I am looking for some advice. I am just a 21M living in Malta. I want to have $150k when I become a father, so I have time, and I can wait for BTC to go up to 1 mill per coin. \n\nThe question is: When should I buy BTC? Is now a good time or should I wait for it to go $80k. Not huge difference now, but it will be in the future. \n\nAll opinions are appreciated! ",

If you have educational materials, tips, or want to send some BCH to help fuel the meetup and future onboarding, here's the address:\n\nbitcoincash:qp5wsnlhh8fesu42clk9z7ztq7l32ck57savwmcx44\n\nYou can also check out what I shared on X:\nMy post on X: https://x.com/alberdioni8406_/status/1990327400002159095?t=UqrmAzM4EuQThKZ9maslRw&s=19\n\nWe're building BCH adoption one person \u2014 one ride \u2014 at a time.\nThanks for being part of this movement, even from afar.\n",
