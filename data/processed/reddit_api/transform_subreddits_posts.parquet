Any idea what sites were up around that time?","22":"I've been trying to understand Bitcoin's economics and I keep running into something that confuses me. Maybe someone can explain where my thinking is wrong.\n\n# The Scenario I'm Imagining\n\nLet's say Bitcoin actually succeeds and becomes widely adopted as currency. Now everyone pays rent, mortgages, and bills in Bitcoin.\n\n**Here's what I don't understand:**\n\n* Rent is due on the 1st of every month for most people\n* If 100 million people all need to pay \\~$1,500 in rent\n* That's $150 billion in demand hitting the market on the same day\n* But supply is fixed at 21 million coins\n\nWouldn't this create massive, predictable price spikes every single month on the 1st?\n\n# My Confusion About Volatility\n\nEveryone says \"Bitcoin's volatility will decrease as adoption grows.\" But wouldn't the opposite happen?\n\n**The more people use Bitcoin for actual transactions, the more synchronized the demand becomes:**\n\n* Monthly bills (rent, utilities, loans)\n* Bi-weekly payrolls\n* Tax deadlines\n* Seasonal shopping (holidays)\n* Quarterly business payments\n\nRight now Bitcoin is volatile from random speculation. But if it's actually used as currency, wouldn't we just replace random volatility with **predictable, synchronized volatility spikes**?\n\n# The Part That Really Confuses Me\n\nIf I get paid in Bitcoin on the 15th, but my rent isn't due until the 1st, I'm exposed to whatever price movement happens between those dates.\n\n**Could my rent effectively become 10-20% more expensive just because \"rent day\" demand spiked the price?**\n\nAnd if I'm wrong about timing, could I lose money just by being one day late converting my paycheck?\n\n# What Am I Missing?\n\nI know people way smarter than me believe in Bitcoin, so I'm clearly missing something. Here are the responses I anticipate, but I don't fully understand them:\n\n**\"Lightning Network solves this\"**\n\n* How? Doesn't it still need to settle on the base layer eventually?\n* Does it somehow eliminate the synchronized demand problem?\n\n**\"People would hold reserves\"**\n\n* What about people living paycheck-to-paycheck?\n* Doesn't this just require everyone to become day-traders?\n\n**\"The market would smooth it out\"**\n\n* Wouldn't arbitrage traders front-run \"rent day\" and make it worse?\n* Can you really arbitrage away a fundamental supply\/demand mismatch?\n\n**\"Adoption would be gradual so behavior adapts\"**\n\n* But we can't change when rent is due or when taxes are owed\n* These cycles are built into society\n\n# My Core Question\n\n**Is there something about Bitcoin's economics that prevents synchronized demand from causing predictable volatility spikes?**\n\nOr is the assumption that Bitcoin never actually becomes widely used for day-to-day transactions, and remains primarily a store of value?\n\nI'm genuinely trying to understand this, not trying to FUD. If someone can explain where my reasoning breaks down, I'd really appreciate it.\n\n  \n\n\n**TL;DR:** If Bitcoin is actually used as currency, wouldn't everyone needing to pay rent on the 1st create predictable monthly demand spikes that make it more volatile, not less?

Native on- and off-ramps in the Revolut app ensure seamless user experience.\n\nIn the Revolut app, users can:\n\n* Send and receive stablecoins (USDC and USDT) over Polygon: With $3.5B and growing in stablecoin supply, Polygon is the go-to thoroughway for low cost stable transfers in crypto. Polygon unlocks the familiarity of traditional financial systems with the low-cost, fast-finality of web3.\u00a0\n* Pay using a Revolut crypto card: Revolut\u2019s in-app crypto card lets users pay for everyday purchases with stablecoins on Polygon\n* Trade and stake POL, the gas and staking token for Polygon: Users can directly stake or trade POL through the Revolut app\n* Zero-fee remittances: Gas costs on eligible transfers are covered, which means free transfers for users, and significant savings for cross-border remittances\n* Offramp to fiat directly within Revolut: Making global payments more seamless than ever\n\nThe first phase of this collaboration continues to see success.\u00a0\n\n# Revolut joins other enterprise solutions on Polygon\n\nRevolut\u2019s integration marks a major step in Web3 adoption, embedded directly into Revolut\u2019s existing app.\n\nAlready, Revolut has 14 million crypto users, demonstrating Polygon's readiness for mainstream financial services. The integration reinforces Polygon\u2019s lead as the go-to blockchain for enterprise payments and stablecoins.\u00a0\n\nRevolut joins other major institutions, enterprises, and governments selecting Polygon as crypto money rails, including:\u00a0\n\n* Stripe, with a majority of volume coming on Polygon and selecting Polygon as first choice for new developments, like recurring subscriptions\n* Flutterwave, Africa\u2019s leading cross-border money and payments infrastructure, selecting Polygon as the default chain\n* DeCard, enabling instant USDC and USDT0 payments 150M+ merchants globally, on Polygon\u00a0\n* As well as, Mastercard, WorldPay, Reliance Jio, NRW BANK and Cashlink, BlackRock and Securitize, , and many others integrating payments and RWAs\n\nPolygon brings stable, reliable, in-production blockchain rails to global institutions, supporting millions of transactions daily with an average transaction fee of fractions of a penny.\n\nRevolut\u2019s integration with Polygon comes on the heels of the network\u2019s most important payments-focused upgrade yet. The Rio upgrade for payments made Polygon faster, lighter, and more reliable, enabling 5,000 transactions per second with near-instant finality and eliminating the risk of reorgs. This means Revolut users, and millions more to come, can move money on rails that settle as fast as messages, cementing Polygon as the go-to blockchain for global payments.\n\nRevolut x Polygon sets the stage for more collaborations in cross-border payments, remittances, and the broader convergence of traditional and decentralized finance.\n\n","29":"Kim Young-hoon - the man officially verified with a 276 IQ - just shocked Crypto Twitter with a wild prediction: \n\nBTC hitting $220,000 in the next 45 days.

It means that it is the most logical point, in which various factors converge (cyclical analyses, on-chain analyses, liquidity pressure);\n\n3) Analysts are NOT infallible, many have different schools of thought, as happens with any non-exact science. Even in medicine there are various schools of thought, but this does not mean that doctors are useless;\n\n4) Breaking that support leads directly to significantly lower support at $63K.\n\nTo date, therefore, considering all aspects, $73-75 K is the highest shared value.\nAfterwards, whether it stays at 89-90 to rise to 200 or whether it drops to 50, no one can say with certainty, but if you want to read with a sense what happens in finance, above 75 (and the further away you go) it is overpaid, below 73 it is undervalued (as established by the analysis of the asset).\n\nI hope this is clearer.","46":"At 5:00 AM Beijing time (5:00 PM Eastern), buy orders on Binance began to be massively withdrawn.  \nBitcoin and altcoins entered a 20-minute free fall \u2014 the entire Binance order book collapsed.  \nThe issue was not that the whole market lacked buyers.  \nThe question is: **why did only Binance\u2019s buy orders disappear?**  \nBinance\u2019s buy-side depth was significantly lower than other exchanges.\n\nIn traditional markets (like NASDAQ or other U.S. stock exchanges), such a \u201cvacuum\u201d is almost impossible \u2014 and certainly not isolated to a single venue.\n\n**1.

Major Market Makers' Cross-Exchange Trading Locked Down\u2014Twilight of the Gods**\n\nAfter buy-side liquidity vanished, major market makers who should have been obligated to provide quotes and support the market faced cross-exchange trading difficulties due to Binance's withdrawal congestion. Market makers like Wintermute, with priority channels and high-speed order placement capabilities, can normally execute even during extreme conditions when the matching engine is overloaded. However, their liquidity is limited. After Binance's order book issues caused price crashes, Wintermute's CEO described being unable to withdraw coins purchased on Binance to sell on Coinbase\u2014preventing them from obtaining funds to redeposit on Binance to maintain buy-side support.\n\nFor example, DOGE fell to $0.095 on Binance, while it was $0.17 on Coinbase at the same time.  \n    \nIf Binance hadn't experienced various technical issues, would a \"buy-side vacuum\" really occur? The answer is clearly no. Consider normal market conditions: when Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 BTC, Bitcoin dropped from $118,000 to $115,000. On October 11, with no major on-chain anomalies detected, Bitcoin plummeted from $117,000 to $101,500 in 30 minutes.  \n  The market's strong buying pressure with nowhere to go was also reflected in the options market\u2014   \n   \n\\- Almost all sell-side liquidity disappeared in the options market; -  \n   \n  Option buy orders continued stacking up, with actual transaction prices far exceeding fair values calculated by the Black-Scholes model.   \n\\- Orders were mostly from professional quantitative institutions; whenever someone posted a remotely reasonable sell price, it was immediately swept by bots.\n\nIn other words, people wanting to buy never truly disappeared\u2014they simply couldn't buy due to various technical reasons. \u3002 If you could buy ATOM at $0.0001, wouldn't you? Obviously you would. Now let's examine the situation for ordinary quant firms and retail traders at the bottom of the food chain.\n\n\n\n**3\u3001 Quants and Retail Wiped Out Without Priority Exchange Access**\n\nDuring this trading anomaly, without access to low-latency matching channels, quant traders and retail investors were completely locked out of the system.  \n   \nMultiple market maker friends reported experiencing hundreds of order retry attempts during the incident. Even ReduceOnly orders (the highest system priority for position reduction) couldn't execute, continuously encountering 503 (Service Unavailable) and -1008 (Service Overloaded) errors\u2014all fully logged. ReduceOnly orders failed to go through; Taker and Maker orders had even less chance.. Bottom-fishing buy orders were universally rejected.  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hkcgf9w9w02g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7454ee08c0e52a85c6c87ee1f487744ac42f02f\n\nIn the end, retail traders\u2014who understood the underlying truth least and created no pressure on the overloaded system\u2014were labeled \"gamblers\" and bore the greatest losses. Their margin was carved up by counterparties and the exchange.\n\n  \n**4\u3001 Collapse of Fake Liquidity**\n\nDoes Binance engage in wash trading?  \n  My answer: 100% yes.  \n   \nEspecially among altcoins that crashed to near-zero during the 10\u00b711 incident \u2014 such as ATOM .  \n  How can a top-50 coin, worth over 1.5b usd go to zero in minutes?\n\nArtificial liquidity made the market look vibrant \u2014 fake depth lured users into an illusion.  \n  But once the matching engine faltered, this fake liquidity collapsed into vacuum\n\n\n\n**5\u3001 Comparison with Fair, Regulated Markets**\n\nAre Binance's market makers actually Binance itself? Does Binance still control a market maker like Sigma Chain\u2014as the SEC once alleged? Was the buy order withdrawal purely a system malfunction or intentional by Binance? I cannot verify this.\n\nBut regardless, market making should follow basic rules.\n\nIn traditional markets like NASDAQ, market maker regulations are extremely strict. Take Rules 4613 and 4619 as examples:\n\n* Market makers must continuously provide two-sided quotes\n* Quote depth and spread (Maximum Allowable Spread) have clear limits\n* If withdrawing due to technical or legal reasons, must apply for \"Excused Withdrawal\"\n* Unexcused Withdrawal results in penalties or delisting\n\nWash Trading is strictly prohibited, with clear role separation between market makers and exchanges. Under such reasonable and fair frameworks, a \"sudden buy-side vacuum\" without major news or concentrated selling pressure is virtually impossible.\n\nBecause a stable closed loop forms between the exchange, users, and market makers.\n\nIn Binance's regulatory vacuum, the situation is completely opposite: Frequent API errors, severely imbalanced order books, and it's unknown whether user funds are being misappropriated to manipulate market prices. There's extreme incentive misalignment between the outsourced teams maintaining the trading system and the exchange. Do they have sufficient motivation to ensure smooth operation of a system generating $70 million in matching fees daily?\n\n\n\n**6\u3001 The Universe's #1 Exchange in a Regulatory Vacuum**\n\nIn this incident:\n\n* Long position holders were liquidated\n* Short position holders (e.g., \"delta neutral\" strategies\u2014buying spot, selling futures) were forcibly auto-deleveraged (ADL) at absurd prices and liquidated at completely unreasonable prices\u2014exactly as Wintermute's CEO described.\n\nThey weren't blind gamblers, yet became sacrifices for Binance's hundred-billion-dollar valuation.\n\nIn a market with virtually no regulatory constraints, when an exchange permits such buy-side vacuums, it's no longer intermediating between buyers and sellers\u2014it's directly counter-trading with users. And users always lose.\n\n  \n**7\u3001 Public Request for Evidence**\n\nWe request Binance submit a \"platform-level minimal proof package\" (unrelated to any individual account) by October 31\uff1a\n\n1\uff09 Pricing\/Mark Price\/Price Bands\n\nMark price per second + algorithm version\n\nIndex components\/weights\/clipping logs (full data for those minutes)\n\nPrice bands (upper\/lower) per second + \"out-of-band rejection volume\" per second + manual intervention status\n\n2\uff09Liquidation\/ADL (System Level)\n\nLiquidation\/ADL order volume and notional, queue length, matching resource allocation (per second)\n\nRisk engine version and parameter changes (event window \u00b11 hour): MMR tables, ADL rules, change logs\n\n3\uff09Insurance Fund\n\nBalance and transactions (per second, including accounts\/counterparties)\n\nFunding gaps and disposal priorities (capital injection\/suspension\/call auction\/price band adjustment)\n\n4\uff09Matching Neutrality \/ Proprietary Net Selling\n\n\"No Proprietary Net Selling Statement\" + Merkle root of proprietary\/affiliated account set\n\nProprietary net Delta and market-making net Delta per-second summary during event window (fields may be anonymized)\n\n5\uff09Operations and Change Control\n\nEvent window \u00b11 hour: \"freeze\/approval records\" and version hashes for parameters\/code\/rate limit thresholds\n\nOverall platform health: p50\/p95 latency, error rate, availability per second; call auction\/circuit breaker trigger records\n\n\n\nThe truth grows clearer through debate.  \n  If you are a **whistleblower** or possess **key evidence**, please step forward to help uncover the truth, Thank you!  \n  \n","47":"First time I\u2019ve seen this from strike.

Working with Mercuryo, the initial issuer onboarding verified users, the companies are introducing verified, username-based transfers that replace long wallet addresses with simple aliases.\n\nThe expansion brings a trusted verification layer directly to self-custody, giving users a familiar way to send and receive assets while keeping full control of their wallets.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a major step toward making self-custody intuitive, secure, and ready for global-scale payments.\n\n# Verified identities meet user-controlled wallets\n\nMastercard Crypto Credential replaces complex addresses with verified user names: human-readable identifiers that map to a user\u2019s wallet. Mercuryo handles KYC onboarding and issuance, ensuring that aliases correspond to real, verified individuals.\n\nOnce verified, users can:\n\n* Link a self-custody wallet to a username-style alias\n* Receive assets using only that alias\n* Opt in to a soulbound credential on Polygon signaling their verified status across the Crypto Credential network\n\nThe result is a user-controlled wallet with a trusted, portable verification layer, without requiring users to give up custody, privacy, or flexibility.\n\nIt\u2019s a UX breakthrough: the simplicity of traditional payments with the self-custody of crypto.\n\n# A simple flow that feels like the internet\n\nExpanding Crypto Credential to self-custody unlocks a clean, universal user experience:\n\n1. Verify once with Mercuryo\n2. Get a username-style alias tied to your identity\n3. Link your self-custody wallet\n4. Optionally mint a soulbound credential signaling verification onchain\n5. Receive crypto via your alias (sending functionality next)\n\nNo more triple-checking hex strings. No more sending a test transaction and praying. Just a familiar flow users already understand.\n\nThis is a major shift in how people interact with blockchain. When verification becomes portable and UX becomes friendly, self-custody stops being a niche skill and starts becoming a default option.\n\n# Why Mastercard chose Polygon\n\nCrypto Credential requires infrastructure that behaves like a global payments network. That means:\n\n* Ease of integration for institutions\n* Reliability & trusted enterprise adoption\n* Sub-cent fees\n* Fast, predictable settlement\n* High throughput under real-world load\n* No reorg risk\n\nPolygon delivers exactly that.\n\nWith the recent Rio upgrade, the network eliminated the risk of reorgs and introduced stateless validation, lowering node costs to make building on Polygon easier than ever before. Combined with the Heimdall v2 consensus upgrade and higher throughput (with 5k TPS coming in the next few months), Polygon achieves near-instant finality, bringing faster settlement times than traditional payments systems.\n\nBillions in stablecoins already move across Polygon monthly, with neobanks, fintechs, and enterprise payment providers relying on the network for speed and reliability. Adding Mastercard Crypto Credential to self-custody workflows is a natural extension of this momentum.\n\nFor institutions, reliability is the differentiator. Polygon\u2019s architecture ensures transfers are final, fast, and cost-efficient, enabling credential verification flows to scale globally.\n\n# Adoption drives scale. Scale drives simplicity.\n\nMastercard\u2019s expansion onto Polygon is another signal in a broader pattern: global payments infrastructure is moving onchain, and Polygon is leading\n\nWhen money builders think about payments, they think about:\n\n* Reliability\n* Trust\n* Finality\n* Throughput\n* Cost efficiency\n\nEvery upgrade to Polygon is designed to enshrine these demands. Credential verification flows, high-frequency transfers, user onboarding, remittances, merchant payouts, and agentic payments all need a network that behaves like the internet.\n\nOn Polygon, they get it.\n\n# Build payments on Polygon\n\nWhether you\u2019re designing wallets, onboarding flows, identity layers, or full-scale payment applications, Polygon provides the speed, reliability, and real-world integrations to support global users.","64":"Sorry everyone.

Waiting? Hedging? Panic-shopping snacks?\n\nLet\u2019s hear how you\u2019re playing this.","113":"","114":"Do you have a favorite crypto trading app? And do you have a different favorite for trading traditionally?","115":"Or did media influencers cycle your liquidity?","116":"Markets often slide slowly\u2014then all at once. Bitcoin\u2019s latest plunge felt exactly like that: a long, nervous drift that abruptly tipped into a rush for the exits. To me, the story isn\u2019t a single villain or a secret switch being flipped; it\u2019s a stack of pressures landing at the same time.\n\nStart with the mood music. Law-enforcement headlines around large crypto seizures changed the psychology of liquidity. Coins tied to cross-border fraud rings being frozen or moved into government custody don\u2019t necessarily hit the market right away, but they do something subtler: they inject the fear of overhang. When traders begin to picture billions of dollars\u2019 worth of supply potentially re-entering the system\u2014someday, somehow\u2014bids thin out and risk premia rise. That alone doesn\u2019t crash a market, yet it makes every other weakness bite harder.\n\nFlows then turned against Bitcoin. The spot-ETF bid that had quietly underwritten upside earlier in the year faded into outflows. When the \u201calways-on\u201d institutional demand steps back, the price suddenly has to discover a lower clearing level. Add a macro backdrop where real rates aren\u2019t obviously falling and the dollar isn\u2019t clearly soft, and dip-buyers become choosier. In that environment, momentum funds don\u2019t wait around\u2014they de-risk.\n\nLeverage did the rest. As spot slipped through widely watched levels, perpetuals went from confident to panicked. Funding swung negative, basis compressed, and a wave of forced selling hit as long positions were liquidated. Liquidations beget more liquidations; order books get thin; wick-downs appear where support should have been. None of this requires a conspiracy\u2014just crowded positioning meeting poor liquidity at the wrong hour.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fabric of the crypto economy to consider. Miners juggle rising energy costs and capex cycles. When prices drop into awkward territory for marginal producers, some supply gets sold to pay bills, which amplifies pressure. Meanwhile, on the demand side, parts of the grey market retreat when compliance risk increases, shrinking the informal throughput that often props up activity during soft patches.\n\nAs for cross-asset knock-ons, it\u2019s tempting to weave grand stories\u2014say, that certain investor cohorts dumped equities to refill crypto operations. The cleaner explanation is simpler: when volatility jumps in one risk bucket, managers de-gross across many. Correlation rises not because of a single country or actor, but because prudent risk control is boring and universal.\n\nWhat would tell me the selloff is burning out? Three things: (1) ETF flows stabilising or flipping positive; (2) derivatives metrics resetting\u2014spot leading perps, funding back toward flat, basis normalising; and (3) realised volatility bleeding lower while order-book depth improves. Until then, rallies will be tested.\n\nIn short, Bitcoin didn\u2019t collapse because of one dramatic plot twist. It cracked because sentiment soured, steady buyers stepped aside, leverage snapped, and liquidity proved shallower than the narrative implied. That mix can reverse\u2014but it usually takes time, patience, and cleaner flow to rebuild trust.","117":"","118":"Wondering what your guys short term bottom price is? Either way im dcaing.

Bitcoin does not work this way. \n\nPeople (I\u2019m people) like to say Bitcoin is currently acting as a store of value but some also seem to misunderstand that this doesn\u2019t guarantee the price of a bitcoin. \n\n**What actually matters is demand.** Unlike anything else in history we know what the supply of bitcoins will be. Exactly like everything else in history we **do not know** what the demand will be. \n\nAll we can do is assume others will eventually learn to understand why Bitcoin is so important and we can assume this will drive up demand for bitcoins. \n\nIn the past we have seen the \u201cfour year cycle\u201d or self fulfilling prophecy come true. But this is not some magical anomaly. It is people believing the prophecy and following it; instead of DCA into the network people are selling out of it. This causes the price of bitcoin to fall relative to other assets and currency. \n\nJust wanted to remind everyone of these things during this downturn. You can\u2019t predict human nature with accuracy but you can verify the supply of bitcoin. \n\nWith all that said, every single bear market has *coincidentally* front run a stock market correction. Every single stock market correction has front run a negative macroeconomic event (QT, major uncertainty, fear, etc). \n\nThis time is somewhat different from a macro perspective. The current fear is an AI bubble and the uncertainty is the Trump administration but rates are being cut and the \u201cmoney printer\u201d is almost certainly going into full swing. They will print their way out of this and that money will have to go somewhere. \n\nMy fear is that the majority will get burned in the AI industry in hopes of solving AGI. My hope is that this doesn\u2019t lead to a 2008 type crash. \n\nTLDR; if you want to contribute to the decline of bitcoin, sell. If you\u2019re scared and uncertain of the future, hold.

","217":"","218":"","219":"All the noise from people keep saying that the next bear market will be a cute little dip. That we would go into \"stocks like environment\" where we see smaller dips, but also smaller gains in coming bulls.\n\nNope.\n\n2026 is shaping up to be the most violent unwinding this space has ever experienced, and almost nobody is ready for it, as the general consensus from retail is the opposite atm.\n\nLet me explain why.  \n\n\n**1. Institutions don\u2019t hodl. They sell. And HARD they will sell.**\n\nThis cycle was the first time Bitcoin became a truly real institutional asset. Sounds bullish on paper, but the reality no one wants to talk about: institutions are forced sellers during recessions.\n\nThey de risk into cash.\n\nThey have clients to protect, redemptions to satisfy and risk rules to follow.\n\nThey are not your diamond handed Twitter influencers or average crypto bro from Reddit.\n\nWhen liquidity dries up, they don\u2019t wait for hopium. They hit the sell button.  \n\n\n**2. The MicroStrategy situation is a ticking bomb. BOMB**. **The \"Tsar bomba\" kind of a bomb.**\n\nEveryone treats MSTR like some \u201csavior of Bitcoin\u201d, but it is basically a publicly traded giga leveraged long BTC position. They have billions in debt and BTC as collateral. If BTC drops -40 to -50%, which it likely will, they get squeezed harder than crypto  gif memes.\n\nIf MSTR starts getting margin pressure or forced collateral adjustments, then the selling pressure will be worse than 3AC, Celsius and Terra combined. We will se a huge black swan event, similar or wose than the FTX event. However, this can be magnificant for retail to entry at low prices.   \n\n\n**3. ETF flows do not just go up.**\n\nYes. We had the first ETF driven bull run ever. But know what? That will follow with the first ETF driven bear run. If there is a recession or just a risk off macro period, ETF outflows will be brutal. Financial advisors will rotate clients into safer assets. Pension funds will reduce risk exposure. Family offices will trim BTC like any other volatile asset. When the lights go off for good (already starting), ETF outflows mean instant sell pressure that retail is not ready for.  \n\n\n**4. Corporate treasuries might have to dump too.**\n\nCompanies holding BTC look cool in a bull run, but when earnings weaken and credit conditions tighten.. Yeah, time to buckle up and say cya. It's natural for boards to tell them to cut risk. Auditors push impairment accounting. Cash becomes the thing again. Corporate selling has not been tested in a real macro downturn. 2026 WILL LIKELY be the first time.  \n\n\n**5. Leverage in this market is insane compared to previous cycles.**\n\nThe amount of perpetuals, options, structured BTC notes and corporate debt collateralized by BTC is ridiculous. When all of that unwinds under macro stress, it won\u2019t be a small minus -30% dip. It will be a face melting liquidity vacuum.  \n\n\n**6. QE will not save you early. It arrives after the pain.**\n\nLast but not least. Most people embrace the hopium of QE starting in 2026. Yes. Probably and actually, likely. But only after the market collapses. Q1-Q2 will be brutal. It will be enough time for the charts to plummet so hard it will go beneath your screen's bottom corner. Yes, after that will likely come QE, but why hold through that when one can sell now and double their position soon?\n\nThe next crash will not be (only) a retail emotional panic.\n\nIt will be an institutional, corporate, leverage driven purge.\n\n\n\nBTC survives. ETH probably survives. SOL might survive but bleed badly. Most altcoins will die and never come back. Many of the TOP 20 and even TOP 50 alts are already down -60% to -80% of their ATH prices. ADA going $0,02 or ALGO below $0,5 or ETH below $1000 are not unlikely scenarios. Some will drop even a lot more. Many big alts will be f\\*\\*d up so hard even their mother will not recognitze them.\n\nSo what I'm kinda trying to say.. If you think 2022 was bad, 2026 is going to surprise you.\n\nNot financial advice, btw.\n\nJust a warning from someone who finally stopped drinking hopium and started looking at the actual market structure we created.","220":"What happens when an inflationary economy meets the most deflationary technology ever created?

Instead of relying on hype cycles or inflationary supply models, a DAT ties a token to real revenue, real accumulation, and a clear economic framework.\n\nBONK\u2019s DAT is managed by Safety Shot, a publicly traded company. Safety Shot is the first public company to hold a memecoin as part of a formal treasury strategy. They currently hold about 2.75 percent of BONK\u2019s total supply and are actively growing toward a stated goal of 5 percent. Safety Shot receives 10 percent of revenue from BONKfun, and roughly 90 percent of that revenue is used for open market BONK accumulation.\n\nThis setup is unusual in the memecoin sector for three reasons.\n\n  \nFirst, BONK has an external buyer that is funded by product usage. As BONKfun grows, so does the revenue. As revenue grows, the DAT buys more BONK. This creates predictable demand that is linked directly to onchain activity.\n\n  \nSecond, Safety Shot is a public company. Public reporting requirements create stability and transparency that most memecoins do not have.\n\n  \nThird, it introduces a clear model for how cultural tokens can evolve. A memecoin with a revenue generating ecosystem and a corporate treasury that accumulates supply is fundamentally different from a token that relies on speculation alone.\n\nMost memecoins do not have a buyer of last resort, a recurring revenue source, or a structured treasury. BONK now has all three.\n\nFor a category that has historically struggled with durability, BONK\u2019s Digital Asset Treasury with Safety Shot may be one of the clearest paths toward a sustainable, long term memecoin economy.","271":"I want to understand crypto TPS, I think TPS is something most crypto networks tries to maximise right?\n\nFor example, Ethereum has a Max Theoretical TPS of 178.6 transactions per second, Solana has a Max Theoretical TPS of 65,000.

A prolonged stock market bear or recession will probably result in a lower low than the table above.\n3. **Trump administration intervention.**\u00a0Trump and his circle are heavily exposed to crypto prices, and could try to intervene to keep prices from falling too much. This could result in a higher low than the four year cycle would predict.\n4. **The four year cycle is dead.**\u00a0There are a number of reasons this could be the case, and a predictable pattern can't last forever.

In short - I have been holding Bitcoin since the end of 2011. To date, I have not sold my Bitcoin, and I have no intention of selling it in the near future. Luckily, I have a fairly large amount of fiat and a good job (which I enjoy doing) so that I can be about my life right now without having to sell my Bitcoin. I will just share my self-reflection from the current dip and the development I went through with myself. I remember Christmas 7 or 8 years ago, when I thought that maybe the end had indeed come. The depression, the crisis and the lack of faith in humanity... Since then, there have been a few more dips that I remember. And with each dip, my faith in the currency seems to be stronger. I have reached a point where the current dip really doesn't change anything. Of course, if in two or three years there is no growth in demand and use of Bitcoin - then this could reflect something negative.  But the bottom line is - Bitcoin solves an existing problem of inflation. Bitcoin is here to stay. It doesn't matter if the value of the currency grows by 25-30 percent relative to some currency that doesn't solve any problem - or in fact - creates the problem.

He said, \u201cWell, play money\u2026 but don\u2019t buy any more of that crap.\u201d\n\nThen I went on a 10-month world trip because I had finished my studies and wanted to explore the world. When I returned in the summer of 2015, my Bitcoin was down 50%.  \nBack then I thought: \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t sell. Either it goes to zero or it recovers!\u201d\n\nIt took until May 29th, 2016 for Bitcoin to climb back to break-even. In the weeks after, it pumped to \u20ac715. Wow! Percentage-wise, better than my stock investments at the time \u2014 which wasn\u2019t hard, since I thought I\u2019d get rich with Chinese solar stocks, which went terribly wrong.\n\nBut the disappointment came right away \u2014 the entire gain was gone again within a few weeks!  \n\u201cDamn!!!!! I should\u2019ve sold, I could have had almost \u20ac300 profit\u2026\u201d  \nLook at the chart on Coinbase: that was on August 3rd, 2016, when I thought, \u201cYou greedy idiot, you should\u2019ve sold!\u201d\n\nBut everything turned out completely different. From there, the price climbed quickly to \u20ac1,000. I was euphoric \u2014 a real fireworks show! I had doubled my money, wow! And suddenly it went straight down again, and I didn\u2019t know whether I should exit or wait\u2026 would it turn around?! I really tore my hair out over it and decided to just let it run.\n\nWhen the price went back up and hit \u20ac2,000, my father said: \u201cCongratulations, my son!!! Insane. Sell now \u2014 it won\u2019t go any higher!\u201d  \nBack then, Bitcoin was framed in the news as the money of and for criminals. In the darknet people still used Bitcoin to buy drugs, weapons and other things. The press coverage was extremely negative and you got mocked from all sides. Really from\u00a0**ABSOLUTELY EVERY**\u00a0side.  \nCompared to today, you can\u2019t even imagine how unbelievably bad the conditions for Bitcoin were back then! Nobody knew it, and the few who did compared it to the tulip bubble.  \nAnd how stupid I must be not to just sell and take the money while I still could.\n\nWhy did I hold out and not sell?  \nAt some point I thought: okay, what if there really\u00a0*is*\u00a0something to this Bitcoin thing? Then I learned more and understood for the first time that Bitcoin is limited and decentralized, and that no company, group, or individual has direct power over BTC.\n\nI had always been a rebel. My school years were pure horror, my parents forced me to study, it was a lot of pressure. When I moved out, went to university and earned my own money, I learned to appreciate freedom. And the 10-month trip through Southeast Asia amplified that \u2014 I had never felt so free and self-determined!\n\nI realized that Bitcoin aligns much more with the values I stand for than fiat money, stocks, gold, etc. I liked the idea that everyone has the same chances and that \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is truly mine\u201d (assuming cold storage) and that Bitcoin cannot be inflated.\n\nSo I decided never to sell. \u201cEither it all goes to zero or it will change my life forever.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t imagine how hard my will was tested. I mean, look at the chart!!! Bitcoin went up to $20,000 \u2014 can you imagine how I felt?! WOW! Only to fall back down to $4,000 in the next bear market.  \nOf course I questioned everything again. Of course I told myself, \u201cYou greedy idiot, you should have sold! $20,000 \u2014 that would have been another 10-month world trip!\u201d\n\nBut then Bitcoin went up again! And seriously, try to put yourself in my shoes while looking at the chart. What a fucking rollercoaster ride!!!\n\nThe worst part for me was the dump from $69,000 down to $16,000. At that point I genuinely thought: okay, it\u2019s over now. The press was EXTREMELY negative, the words \u201cBitcoin ban\u201d were floating around, banks warned and demonized Bitcoin, and my dad said: \u201cWhat do you mean you didn\u2019t sell?! Are you crazy?!\u201d  \nAll the jealous people laughing behind their hands, convinced it would finally crash to zero.\n\nAnd my dream of freedom was gone! I was so devastated that I told myself: screw the $16,000, that won\u2019t change my life anyway. Sure, it would be a nice vacation, maybe a motorcycle, but I want to be free, damn it! I hate my IT job \u2014 the constant meetings, 30 days of vacation, 9-to-5 work. I can\u2019t stand it. (I should add that I earned very well \u2014 but I hated the job.)\n\nAgain, I decided not to sell and to stay in until Bitcoin goes to zero.\n\nWhen Bitcoin, to my total surprise, climbed back to $30k, I decided (again....) that I will\u00a0*never*\u00a0sell. I found it hard to believe that something so often pronounced dead could ever be killed, considering how resilient it keeps showing itself to be.  \nSo I started using my good salary to buy BTC from time to time.\n\nI bought Bitcoin at $26k, $40k, $50k, $60k, $80k, $90k, $100k, $110k, $120k.\n\nIf you\u2019re asking how I feel about the current correction:  \nI\u2019m insanely chill! The news couldn\u2019t be better. Seriously \u2014 states, pension funds, BlackRock ETF, Harvard, central banks\u2026 more and more are speaking in favor of BTC. What a\u00a0**BRUTAL**\u00a0difference compared to the old days.\n\nOf course it will remain volatile! It\u2019s the best store of value in human history, and people with huge wealth make a fortune from this volatility.\n\nTo all of you normal folks out there: I beg you sincerely \u2014 don\u2019t play this game and don\u2019t get confused by the noise. Buy Bitcoin and hold Bitcoin. That\u2019s all you need to do. And please don\u2019t drive yourselves crazy. I know how hard it is, and how easy it sounds when some anonymous internet dude like me says it.\n\nDo it like I did. Compare your own values with the values Bitcoin stands for. And then decide which side you want to be on. It will be worth it!\n\nI believe in a fairer and better world, and Bitcoin is the fair store of value for all of us.\n\nAll the best and let\u00b4s ride this together!\n\np.s. I quit my job 4 years ago and i live a free live. I will never work in IT again and i am now on my way to become a Personal Trainer, as Fitness, Nutrition and Health was always something I was interested about and loved doing.\n\n(Not financial advice.

The dark blue area is coins <7d old; the warmer colors are older holders. Even as price grinds lower, \\~94% of the BTC spent here comes from coins younger than a week, with heavy realized losses. 30\u201390d coins are also locking in big losses. In contrast, 180d+ cohorts are a small share of volume and, when they do move, they\u2019re mostly realizing profits... not panic dumping.\n\nIn other words: this drawdown is being driven primarily by recent buyers and short-term traders puking coins at a loss, while long-term holders are barely flinching and selectively taking profit. That doesn\u2019t guarantee we\u2019ve found the floor, but on-chain it still looks more like a classic bull-market shakeout than full-cycle capitulation.","391":"","392":"There are thousands of central bank and government reps around the world defending fiat.

I know technical analysis isn\u2019t 100% accurate, but historically an RSI of 30 or below combined with \u201cextreme fear\u201d on the Fear & Greed Index has *always* been a buy zone, not a sell zone.

I wonder if others feel the same.\n\n\\- I'd say this dip is caused by unsophisticated investors who believe that prices should follow predictable four year cycles, which is financial nonsense. Assets are efficiently priced and if they followed predictable schedules everyone would be a trillionaire. Ironically, because many people seem to believe it, there may be a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy going on, but because these people are selling to front run a 2026 bear market, that bear market may actually already be over before 2026 hits, causing current sellers to lose out on gains.\n\n\\- Bitcoin is probably closer to putting in a bottom than most people think. Sentiment is rotten and I have to suspect most people who plan on selling will have sold by now.\n\n\\- Altz did not put in convincing new highs and will probably never recover. Unlike Bitcoin, they do not have the credible decentralisation and network effects that are required to be considered a neutral form of money. Also, their techonological promises have turned out to be BS, with the possible exception of stablecoins. Though stablecoins could actually run perfectly fine on a permissioned blockchain as they are a centralised asset anyway. When the four year cycle is revealed to be nonsense, that's it for altz.\n\nMy guess: we'll see a short, shallow bear market caused by unsophisticated sellers and 2026 will actually be a big up year.

","432":"","433":"# One of the most visible shifts in recent years is the quiet transformation of what it means to be human inside a civilization. For a long time, a person\u2019s entire destiny was anchored to their point of birth\u2014nationality, family, identity, institutions, culture, language. These were not labels; they were the outer shell that defined your coordinates in the world. They told you who you were allowed to be and silently informed you of the boundaries you could never cross. It was a complete structure, and most people lived their entire lives inside it without ever questioning its shape.\n\nBut as the world moves deeper into higher complexity, that outer shell has begun to loosen. More and more of your real agency no longer depends on where you were born, but on **how** you are connected. It\u2019s no longer about belonging to a place, but about being readable by a global system. Your capabilities, opportunities, and even your trajectory are starting to be determined less by geography and more by the networks you plug into. Identity is gradually shifting from something assigned to something discovered.\n\nThis shift isn\u2019t philosophical. It\u2019s structural.\n\nAs civilization transitions from a geographic architecture to a networked one, a human being naturally transitions from a geographic identity to a network identity. The more you observe the deep trends, the clearer it becomes: the \u201csovereign individual\u201d is not an idea people believe in\u2014it is the shape the future demands. It is a functional outcome of how a more complex world must operate.\n\nIn the old world, the nation was the primary unit and the person was the smallest one.  \nIn the emerging world, the network is the primary unit and the node is the smallest one.\n\nFor the first time, an individual can exist like a node\u2014independent, verifiable, portable, autonomous, able to operate across borders, and not tied to any specific institution. This isn't empowerment; it\u2019s a redesign of the human interface.\n\nA person is beginning to be treated less like a citizen of a location and more like an object the system can authenticate: a set of keys, a trail of on-chain proofs, a collection of digital assets, a history of interactions. Credit becomes something you prove yourself, not something handed down by institutions. Value becomes something you generate inside networks, not something assigned by organizations. Your boundary shifts from where your body lives to the systems you participate in.\n\nThis transformation is profound precisely because no one needs to promote it and no one can stop it. It arises naturally from the metabolism of a civilization facing more complexity than its old architecture can handle.\n\nWhen systems grow too large, authority naturally decentralizes.  \nWhen coordination becomes too difficult, power naturally distributes.  \nWhen institutions can no longer guarantee coherence, trust migrates to protocols.  \nWhen geography limits opportunity, identity migrates to networks.  \nWhen the old world loses functionality, the new one grows underneath it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t ideology\u2014it\u2019s the physics of complex systems.\n\nYou can think of the future as a \u201cself-declared civilization\u201d where individuals don\u2019t wait for recognition from institutions; they demonstrate who they are to the system itself. You no longer need a nation to validate you, because the new infrastructure allows you to validate yourself. Once identity becomes verifiable, assets portable, reputation recordable, and value globally accessible, a person can finally detach from the old shell without losing coherence.\n\nThe sovereign individual is not someone trying to escape the state.  \nIt is someone given an additional layer of existence.  \nNot outside civilization, but parallel to it.  \nNot rejecting the old world, but no longer confined to it.\n\nThe future individual will exist like an API\u2014readable, trustworthy, collaborative, portable.  \nIdentity will no longer be a single binding; it will be a multi-chain presence.  \nDestiny will no longer be defined by institutions; it will be shaped by the networks you choose.  \nFreedom will no longer be a granted permission; it will be an interoperability feature.\n\nThose who understand this shift early will move first\u2014not by abandoning their countries, but by acquiring a new dimension of identity. Not by rejecting society, but by gaining a second space to operate from.\n\nCivilization is rewriting the definition of a person, not to fulfill an ideal, but to solve the scale of the world it is becoming.

Exhibit 6 breaks down a 51% attack\u2019s potential inputs based on Exhibit 3\u2019s cost-of-mining analysis and assumes the instant availability of mining machines, which is, of course, unrealistic. Hardware is the largest expenditure, about $4.6 billion at current prices.

A malicious actor (or group of actors) with sufficient resources, planning ahead and stockpiling mining hardware, could theoretically pull off such an attack.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on this?

The more I look at Bitcoin, the more convinced I am that its core premises are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how money, risk, and the economy actually work. This is a risk asset, full stop. Not a hedge.\n\nThe 21 million cap is treated as gospel, but it's economically disastrous for a currency. In a growing economy (more goods, services, and people), a fixed money supply means prices must constantly fall (deflation). This crushes economic growth. Why would anyone spend or invest today when their money is guaranteed to be worth more tomorrow just by holding it? It encourages hoarding, not commerce. It also makes simple concepts like getting a raise a nightmare. For your employer to give you a raise in real terms, they would have to pay you less Bitcoin as its purchasing power rises. For one person to gain, another must lose. It creates a parasitic, zero-sum mindset instead of a growth-oriented one.\n\nThe \"inflation hedge\" argument is often based on a high-school-level reading of the Quantity Theory of Money (MV=PQ). The idea that an increase in Money Supply (M) directly causes an increase in Prices (P) is a wild oversimplification. This theory only holds if the Velocity of Money (V) and real GDP (Q) are constant. In the real world, they are not. Velocity has been in a structural decline for decades. Central banks don't manage the supply of money; they manage the price of money (interest rates) to target inflation (prices). Bitcoin's \"fixed supply\" is a rigid solution to a problem that is far more dynamic and complex.\n\nBitcoin's core value prop is eliminating the middleman. This is a bug, not a feature. A third party (a bank, a credit card company) is an asset to the financial system. They provide essential consumer protections like fraud resolution, transaction reversal, and chargebacks for services not rendered. In a trustless, irreversible system, \"Not your keys, not your coins\" also means \"Your mistake, your total loss.\" If you get scammed, send funds to the wrong address, or have your wallet drained, you have zero recourse. The main beneficiaries of a system with no middleman are criminals.\n\nThe original whitepaper title was \"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\" The community pivoted to \"Digital Gold\" because Bitcoin failed miserably at being cash. The proof is stablecoins. If Bitcoin was the perfect settlement asset, why is the entire crypto-economy built on stablecoins? The crypto world itself runs on USD-backed tokens (USDT, USDC). This is a clear signal that even crypto users will not tolerate a volatile asset for transactions. The bull counter is that the Lightning Network makes it fast. But the volatility is the problem, not just the speed. No merchant will accept a payment that could be worth 5% less by the time they settle their books. No business will expose itself to that speculative risk.\n\nBitcoiners argue the \"TradFi\" system is slow and archaic. This was true. But that delay was often a feature, not a bug, it generated \"float revenue\" for banks. Crypto lit a fire under the industry. Now we have SWIFT GPI (Nearly 60% of international payments are credited in under 30 minutes) and real-time payment networks (FedNow in the US, NPP in Australia, etc.). The real long-term digital strategy isn't a decentralized, volatile asset. It's Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). These will be centralized, regulated, and stable. The existing financial system will simply pivot to be the interlinking network for this new system.\n\nTo sum it up: Crypto doesn't solve a problem that traditional banking can't (and isn't already) solving itself.\n\nTL;DR: Bitcoin is a high-risk, speculative asset. It is not an inflation hedge, it's not a currency, and its fixed-supply economic model is fundamentally flawed.\n\n\u00a0","487":"","488":"Anyone know about this?

People live inside nations, but they operate inside systems\n\nWe usually interpret our lives through the lens of politics, society, and culture.\nBut if you look past the surface, you\u2019ll notice something else:\n\nMost of a person\u2019s \u201cfreedom\u201d is actually the output of a larger structural logic.\n\nThings like:\n\t\u2022\tYour social mobility\n\t\u2022\tYour opportunities\n\t\u2022\tYour emotional responses\n\t\u2022\tYour sense of meaning\n\t\u2022\tEven your \u201cpersonal decisions\u201d\n\nall follow patterns that are too consistent to be purely individual.\n\nIn other words:\nyou\u2019re not just living your life\u2014you\u2019re executing a system\u2019s scripts.\n\nNot because someone wrote them for you,\nbut because that\u2019s how large-scale civilizations evolve.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. Civilization has base stats, just like a game\n\nIf an RPG has STR, INT, VIT, and CHA,\nthen modern human life runs on four comparable stats:\n\nPhysical capacity, mental stability, cognitive models, and social influence.\n\nThese four attributes quietly determine:\n\t\u2022\tHow far you can go\n\t\u2022\tWhat paths you can see\n\t\u2022\tHow you react to uncertainty\n\t\u2022\tHow much the world \u201cpushes back\u201d\n\t\u2022\tWhat level of complexity you can handle\n\nPeople think hard work is the whole story.\nBut hard work is just one modifier applied on top of much larger variables.\n\nCivilization doesn\u2019t care about your intentions;\nit only reads your parameters.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. The old world ran on two engines: the Dollar and the Value System\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the real \u201csource code\u201d of modern civilization, it\u2019s not kings, territory, or ideology.\n\nIt\u2019s two things:\n\n1. The U.S. Dollar \u2014 the global energy distribution engine\n2. The Western value framework \u2014 the global meaning and order engine\n\nThe dollar decides:\n\t\u2022\twhere capital flows\n\t\u2022\thow resources are priced\n\t\u2022\twhich countries rise or fall\n\t\u2022\twhat technologies get funded\n\nThe value system decides:\n\t\u2022\tlaw\n\t\u2022\tmorality\n\t\u2022\tfamily structure\n\t\u2022\tpolitical norms\n\t\u2022\tideas of success and legitimacy\n\nFor about 70 years, these two engines synchronized perfectly.\n\nThat era is ending.\n\nNot because of politics,\nbut because all complex systems eventually hit the limits of their architecture.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. The signs of an aging civilization system\n\nOld systems don\u2019t collapse overnight.\nThey fade.\n\nYou see it in things like:\n\t\u2022\tdeclining trust\n\t\u2022\tfractured identity\n\t\u2022\tinconsistent rules\n\t\u2022\toverextended debt-based growth\n\t\u2022\tinstitutions that can\u2019t keep up with technology\n\t\u2022\tconflicting value systems\n\t\u2022\tpeople feeling \u201clost\u201d despite material abundance\n\nThese aren\u2019t random crises.\nThey\u2019re symptoms of a system reaching the end of its scaling curve.\n\nCivilization is not breaking;\nit\u2019s outgrowing its software.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5. AI and blockchains are emerging as replacement engines\n\nThis isn\u2019t hype\u2014it\u2019s structural inevitability.\n\nAI solves the problem of \u201ccomplexity beyond human management.\u201d\nIt becomes the new intelligence layer of civilization.\n\nBlockchains solve the problem of \u201ctrust without central authority.\u201d\nThey become the new order layer of civilization.\n\nOne replaces the cognitive bottleneck,\nthe other replaces the institutional bottleneck.\n\nTogether they form:\n\na new operating system for a new kind of civilization.\n\nWe are witnessing the handoff from old rules to new protocols.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n6. The individual is shifting from \u201ccitizen\u201d \u2192 \u201csovereign actor\u201d\n\nFor most of history, your identity was tied to:\n\t\u2022\tbirthplace\n\t\u2022\tethnicity\n\t\u2022\tclass\n\t\u2022\tinstitution\n\t\u2022\tnational systems\n\nBut digital life is erasing those boundaries.\nYour value is increasingly determined by:\n\t\u2022\tyour skills\n\t\u2022\tyour network\n\t\u2022\tyour digital footprint\n\t\u2022\tyour ability to plug into global systems\n\t\u2022\tyour capacity to navigate complexity\n\nThe center of gravity is shifting from nation-defined humans\nto network-defined humans.\n\nThis is the early stage of a major civilizational transition.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n7. We\u2019re not watching the world end; we\u2019re watching its software update\n\nCivilizational transitions don\u2019t announce themselves.\nThey don\u2019t come with fireworks or manifestos.\n\nThey look exactly like what we\u2019re experiencing now:\n\t\u2022\told systems quietly losing coherence\n\t\u2022\tnew systems quietly gaining traction\n\t\u2022\tconfusion at the edges\n\t\u2022\topportunity in the cracks\n\t\u2022\tindividuals suddenly able to do things once exclusive to states\n\nWe aren\u2019t collapsing.\nWe\u2019re migrating.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nPeople think they\u2019re living their personal lives.\nBut at a deeper level, they\u2019re participating in a once-in-a-century system upgrade.\n\nAnd for those paying attention,\nthe upgrade screen is already visible.","498":"","499":"Sometimes when the market gets noisy, I just go back and read the Bitcoin whitepaper again and again.

I see more posts about buying more, holding the line and getting those discounts. \n\n  \nWe are reaching the end of a debt cycle. A long and brutal one that began in the ashes of 2009 when rates were cut to near zero. It happened again just in time during the pandemic, breathing a little more life into the bubble. Now we are reaching the end. The debt is maturing in the next 2 years and when it comes due, it will take the rest of the market with it. UNLESS rates are cut. Loans will be refinanced and we will keep plotting along as everything slowly falls apart. Both outcomes are good for bitcoin. In the first, we will see the price of bitcoin absolutely crater. It will be a disaster. The over leveraged financial institutions will sell up to save their own asses. So you buy more. You acquire what they couldn't afford. Eventually things will settle. Prices come down, the economy deflates and has some horrible GDP numbers for a few years but eventually it all starts over again. Maybe this time will be different (new defi, digital currencies whatever who knows). But it will end the same. The credit starts flowing, the banks get hungry, prices go up, bitcoin goes up. Scenario two is a little different. We decide we don't want to pop the bubble just yet. We need MORE. Rates drop to near zero quickly, money flows in, the price of bitcoin barely settles before going up and up as the dollar goes down down. \n\n  \nEither way you can't really lose. The fundamentals of btc never change. There will always be a set amount released, we know how much and when. The dollar will always play games so every cycle will play out the same.

I just want to share the concept and get community thoughts on the model itself.\n\n**What it actually is:**\n\nIt's basically a way for people to experiment with mining without buying hardware. Users pick a coin, pick a small package (from tiny 3-hour ones to larger rentals), and the mining is done using rented rigs from external marketplaces. The platform itself doesn't hold any mined coins, payouts go directly from the pool to the user\u2019s wallet.\n\n**Why I built it:**\n\nI noticed a lot of people are interested in mining but don't want to deal with:\n\n* high hardware costs\n* noise\/heat\n* electricity issues\n* setup\/config\n* maintaining miners So I thought a simple \u201cclick, mine, done\u201d interface could make the whole experience more accessible.\n\n**How it works behind the scenes:**\n\n* It sources hashrate from existing rig-rental networks\n* Coins include BTC, LTC, DOGE, KAS, BCH, RVN, XMR, and others\n* The goal is to make it cheap to try, some rentals are just a few dollars\n* Results depend entirely on the network difficulty and luck (especially solo mining)\n* The platform earns a small margin between rental cost and package price\n* There's no token, no investment scheme, no staking, and no promises of returns\n\n**Why I'm sharing this here:**\n\nI know mining discussions here often split into:\n\n* \u201cDIY or nothing\u201d\n* \u201cCloud mining is a scam\u201d So I'd genuinely like honest feedback about this *SaaS-rental* model. It's transparent, doesn't promise profit, and doesn't act as a custodian, but I'd love to hear how the wider community views this kind of platform.\n\n**Do you see value in lowering the barrier to mining?**  \nOr does the community prefer sticking to hardware-based setups?\n\nHappy to answer *general* questions about the model.\n\nThanks!","705":"\nShout out to Bitcoin Dad for sharing the wisdom.

Bitcoin kinda bottoms at the $97000, $106k and $103k levels consecutively for 3-4 times wiyhin last a few months \n2. The volume of the after new high crash is very high. It's almost 3 times more than regular daily volume \n3. It's forming some kind of cup curve bottom with a slight newer high every time. \n4. From technical standpoint, it's crashed through 200 day averages for consecutively 15 days or so. \n\nFrom a trader's view, It's bottoming on going and looks to me is waiting for a catalyst to move. \n\nPersonally, I've allocated enough to bitcoin as a speculative asset and I added more every day in small $ in the past year. However, by looking at the crashing volume, I would not suggest you dca now with too big of an amount. \n\nIBIT and hodl are both good instruments to be exposed to bitcoin. \n\nKeep dcaing with very little amount is probably the trick. \n\nA few things to share with our newer hodlers","998":"I chart the hourly mix of \u22657d coin spends by age band and overlay BTC price; lower panel shows realized P&L by band (log).
