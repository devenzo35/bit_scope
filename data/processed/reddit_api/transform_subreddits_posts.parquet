However, this framing overlooks the role of denominational flexibility. Bitcoin\u2019s current smallest unit is the satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), but this limit is not intrinsic. It is a protocol parameter that can be modified through consensus if economic conditions require finer divisibility.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s value increases, transaction amounts logically decrease. When a single satoshi represents too much purchasing power, the system can introduce units smaller than one satoshi. Although the nominal supply of bitcoins remains capped, the count of spendable units can expand. This expansion effectively increases the \u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201ccirculating\u201d supply, because more discrete units are available for commerce and valuation.\n\nThis creates a dynamic similar to fiat: economic growth leads to an increase in usable monetary units, even without altering headline supply. Bitcoin\u2019s cap remains mathematically true, yet its practical money supply adapts. It\u2019s a subtle but important reminder that monetary scarcity is not defined solely by the number of coins, but also by how finely those coins can be divided.\n\nMy point:\nThe idea Bitcoin has a \u201chard capped supply\u201d is a misunderstanding.","204":"Shouldn\u2019t they be buying bitcoin for their ETF or balance sheet reserves?","205":"","206":"","207":"It seems to be the only fully lot device minable blockchain that i could find.

Funding was provided by Brink with the support of our donors, with technical collaboration from Brink engineer, Niklas G\u00f6gge, and Chaincode Labs engineer, Antoine Poinsot.\n\nWhy Brink funded this work\n\nThe project has a strong security track record, but it has never undergone an external security assessment. We wanted to provide an additional layer of assurance for developers, node operators, holders, and businesses who rely on Bitcoin Core every day\n\nWhat the audit involved\n\nThe focus was on the most security-critical components of the software, including the peer-to-peer networking layer, mempool, chain management, and consensus logic and included:\n\n\\- Manual code review  \n\\- Static and dynamic analysis  \n\\- Advanced fuzz testing\n\nWhat the auditors found\n\nThe auditors at Quarkslab reported no critical, high, or medium-severity issues. They identified two low-severity findings and thirteen informational recommendations, none of which were classified as security vulnerabilities under Bitcoin Core\u2019s criteria.\n\nFunding independent reviews like this is just one way we help ensure Bitcoin doesn\u2019t break and continues to serve the world as a secure, reliable monetary network.\n\nIndependent review only strengthens that confidence.\n\nThank you to Quarkslab, the OSTIF, Niklas, and Antoine for their work on this project.\n\nThe full report is publicly available here:\n\n[https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/11\/25-05-2133-REP-bitcoincore-security-assessment-V1.3.pdf](https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/11\/25-05-2133-REP-bitcoincore-security-assessment-V1.3.pdf)","253":"","254":"Let's hypothetically say you have a million dollars worth of Bitcoin that you want to sell for fiat and cash out to a brokerage account.

Nobody cares either when people shill their bags.\n\nCrypto is not a regular market. Ups and downs are normal for markets. But regular markets have underlying real, tangible value. Stuff. There's no stuff behind 95% (made up figure to make my point) of crypto.\n\nCrypto is rather gambling. And as such, it doesn't need to be overly regulated or even banned. But gambling is very different than a market. Especially psychologically to people. It's definitely NO economic game changer. Try your luck at your own risk.\n\nAs it's purely digital and virtual, there's no bottom and there's no roof at to where the price can go. Which swings widely and wlidly mostly on pure sentiment. There's no real economic metric underpinning the movements. There are not a whole lot of economy affecting jobs (well, devs, influencers, comms managers, marketing for sure) behind it, nor materials, nor services. Not even utility!\n\nThere are a handful of exceptions. Bitcoin of course can be perceived as digital gold. But it's not doing a great job at it. Unlike physical gold, bitcoin can go as low as it gets. It's price is too speculative to function as gold. Every asset sees price moves, but from a digital gold - by MY INDIVIDUAL expectation  - I expect SOME stability and predictability. And right when I need my asset to give me stability - in terms of hedging when things look concerning - it tanks. It goes up when everything else goes up. That's NOT the utility of digital gold -> I <\u2010 am looking for.\n\nSome other coins have a bit of utility. Ethereum is hailed for its smart contracts - but it's mainly used for DeFi. Shuffling more virtual stuff around to make virtual profits (or losses) which you can ephimerally make. How's that different from gambling?\n\nAvalanche and a few other coins made one right move: anker their utility in real world stuff (RWA). But their market power is too weak to move on their own, and thus are subject to the general sentiments. Plus, regulatory and legal hurdles,  but also the actual handling of fractional or digitized ownership for people, needs more maturing.\n\nTherefore I conclude: crypto degenerated into (mostly) pure gambling. Mind you, no newcomer here, first heard about bitcoin in 2012. I was concerned about its energy use back then, or I would be rich now. But that's a different story.\n\nThe emperor has no clothes. But of course the shillers and whales don't want you to believe that.  \n\nThe problem is not the tech. I entered crypto because of its, well, liberating *potential*. But as always, the problem is the use humans give to tech. It could be used differently but 99% are not interested.

Brazil signed onto the CARF joint statement in late 2023 and has been building towards this since then.\n\nOther major jurisdictions are lining up too.

It means that it is the most logical point, in which various factors converge (cyclical analyses, on-chain analyses, liquidity pressure);\n\n3) Analysts are NOT infallible, many have different schools of thought, as happens with any non-exact science. Even in medicine there are various schools of thought, but this does not mean that doctors are useless;\n\n4) Breaking that support leads directly to significantly lower support at $63K.\n\nTo date, therefore, considering all aspects, $73-75 K is the highest shared value.\nAfterwards, whether it stays at 89-90 to rise to 200 or whether it drops to 50, no one can say with certainty, but if you want to read with a sense what happens in finance, above 75 (and the further away you go) it is overpaid, below 73 it is undervalued (as established by the analysis of the asset).\n\nI hope this is clearer.","431":"At 5:00 AM Beijing time (5:00 PM Eastern), buy orders on Binance began to be massively withdrawn.  \nBitcoin and altcoins entered a 20-minute free fall \u2014 the entire Binance order book collapsed.  \nThe issue was not that the whole market lacked buyers.  \nThe question is: **why did only Binance\u2019s buy orders disappear?**  \nBinance\u2019s buy-side depth was significantly lower than other exchanges.\n\nIn traditional markets (like NASDAQ or other U.S. stock exchanges), such a \u201cvacuum\u201d is almost impossible \u2014 and certainly not isolated to a single venue.\n\n**1.

Major Market Makers' Cross-Exchange Trading Locked Down\u2014Twilight of the Gods**\n\nAfter buy-side liquidity vanished, major market makers who should have been obligated to provide quotes and support the market faced cross-exchange trading difficulties due to Binance's withdrawal congestion. Market makers like Wintermute, with priority channels and high-speed order placement capabilities, can normally execute even during extreme conditions when the matching engine is overloaded. However, their liquidity is limited. After Binance's order book issues caused price crashes, Wintermute's CEO described being unable to withdraw coins purchased on Binance to sell on Coinbase\u2014preventing them from obtaining funds to redeposit on Binance to maintain buy-side support.\n\nFor example, DOGE fell to $0.095 on Binance, while it was $0.17 on Coinbase at the same time.  \n    \nIf Binance hadn't experienced various technical issues, would a \"buy-side vacuum\" really occur? The answer is clearly no. Consider normal market conditions: when Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 BTC, Bitcoin dropped from $118,000 to $115,000. On October 11, with no major on-chain anomalies detected, Bitcoin plummeted from $117,000 to $101,500 in 30 minutes.  \n  The market's strong buying pressure with nowhere to go was also reflected in the options market\u2014   \n   \n\\- Almost all sell-side liquidity disappeared in the options market; -  \n   \n  Option buy orders continued stacking up, with actual transaction prices far exceeding fair values calculated by the Black-Scholes model.   \n\\- Orders were mostly from professional quantitative institutions; whenever someone posted a remotely reasonable sell price, it was immediately swept by bots.\n\nIn other words, people wanting to buy never truly disappeared\u2014they simply couldn't buy due to various technical reasons. \u3002 If you could buy ATOM at $0.0001, wouldn't you? Obviously you would. Now let's examine the situation for ordinary quant firms and retail traders at the bottom of the food chain.\n\n\n\n**3\u3001 Quants and Retail Wiped Out Without Priority Exchange Access**\n\nDuring this trading anomaly, without access to low-latency matching channels, quant traders and retail investors were completely locked out of the system.  \n   \nMultiple market maker friends reported experiencing hundreds of order retry attempts during the incident. Even ReduceOnly orders (the highest system priority for position reduction) couldn't execute, continuously encountering 503 (Service Unavailable) and -1008 (Service Overloaded) errors\u2014all fully logged. ReduceOnly orders failed to go through; Taker and Maker orders had even less chance.. Bottom-fishing buy orders were universally rejected.  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hkcgf9w9w02g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7454ee08c0e52a85c6c87ee1f487744ac42f02f\n\nIn the end, retail traders\u2014who understood the underlying truth least and created no pressure on the overloaded system\u2014were labeled \"gamblers\" and bore the greatest losses. Their margin was carved up by counterparties and the exchange.\n\n  \n**4\u3001 Collapse of Fake Liquidity**\n\nDoes Binance engage in wash trading?  \n  My answer: 100% yes.  \n   \nEspecially among altcoins that crashed to near-zero during the 10\u00b711 incident \u2014 such as ATOM .  \n  How can a top-50 coin, worth over 1.5b usd go to zero in minutes?\n\nArtificial liquidity made the market look vibrant \u2014 fake depth lured users into an illusion.  \n  But once the matching engine faltered, this fake liquidity collapsed into vacuum\n\n\n\n**5\u3001 Comparison with Fair, Regulated Markets**\n\nAre Binance's market makers actually Binance itself? Does Binance still control a market maker like Sigma Chain\u2014as the SEC once alleged? Was the buy order withdrawal purely a system malfunction or intentional by Binance? I cannot verify this.\n\nBut regardless, market making should follow basic rules.\n\nIn traditional markets like NASDAQ, market maker regulations are extremely strict. Take Rules 4613 and 4619 as examples:\n\n* Market makers must continuously provide two-sided quotes\n* Quote depth and spread (Maximum Allowable Spread) have clear limits\n* If withdrawing due to technical or legal reasons, must apply for \"Excused Withdrawal\"\n* Unexcused Withdrawal results in penalties or delisting\n\nWash Trading is strictly prohibited, with clear role separation between market makers and exchanges. Under such reasonable and fair frameworks, a \"sudden buy-side vacuum\" without major news or concentrated selling pressure is virtually impossible.\n\nBecause a stable closed loop forms between the exchange, users, and market makers.\n\nIn Binance's regulatory vacuum, the situation is completely opposite: Frequent API errors, severely imbalanced order books, and it's unknown whether user funds are being misappropriated to manipulate market prices. There's extreme incentive misalignment between the outsourced teams maintaining the trading system and the exchange. Do they have sufficient motivation to ensure smooth operation of a system generating $70 million in matching fees daily?\n\n\n\n**6\u3001 The Universe's #1 Exchange in a Regulatory Vacuum**\n\nIn this incident:\n\n* Long position holders were liquidated\n* Short position holders (e.g., \"delta neutral\" strategies\u2014buying spot, selling futures) were forcibly auto-deleveraged (ADL) at absurd prices and liquidated at completely unreasonable prices\u2014exactly as Wintermute's CEO described.\n\nThey weren't blind gamblers, yet became sacrifices for Binance's hundred-billion-dollar valuation.\n\nIn a market with virtually no regulatory constraints, when an exchange permits such buy-side vacuums, it's no longer intermediating between buyers and sellers\u2014it's directly counter-trading with users. And users always lose.\n\n  \n**7\u3001 Public Request for Evidence**\n\nWe request Binance submit a \"platform-level minimal proof package\" (unrelated to any individual account) by October 31\uff1a\n\n1\uff09 Pricing\/Mark Price\/Price Bands\n\nMark price per second + algorithm version\n\nIndex components\/weights\/clipping logs (full data for those minutes)\n\nPrice bands (upper\/lower) per second + \"out-of-band rejection volume\" per second + manual intervention status\n\n2\uff09Liquidation\/ADL (System Level)\n\nLiquidation\/ADL order volume and notional, queue length, matching resource allocation (per second)\n\nRisk engine version and parameter changes (event window \u00b11 hour): MMR tables, ADL rules, change logs\n\n3\uff09Insurance Fund\n\nBalance and transactions (per second, including accounts\/counterparties)\n\nFunding gaps and disposal priorities (capital injection\/suspension\/call auction\/price band adjustment)\n\n4\uff09Matching Neutrality \/ Proprietary Net Selling\n\n\"No Proprietary Net Selling Statement\" + Merkle root of proprietary\/affiliated account set\n\nProprietary net Delta and market-making net Delta per-second summary during event window (fields may be anonymized)\n\n5\uff09Operations and Change Control\n\nEvent window \u00b11 hour: \"freeze\/approval records\" and version hashes for parameters\/code\/rate limit thresholds\n\nOverall platform health: p50\/p95 latency, error rate, availability per second; call auction\/circuit breaker trigger records\n\n\n\nThe truth grows clearer through debate.  \n  If you are a **whistleblower** or possess **key evidence**, please step forward to help uncover the truth, Thank you!  \n  \n","432":"First time I\u2019ve seen this from strike.

Working with Mercuryo, the initial issuer onboarding verified users, the companies are introducing verified, username-based transfers that replace long wallet addresses with simple aliases.\n\nThe expansion brings a trusted verification layer directly to self-custody, giving users a familiar way to send and receive assets while keeping full control of their wallets.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a major step toward making self-custody intuitive, secure, and ready for global-scale payments.\n\n# Verified identities meet user-controlled wallets\n\nMastercard Crypto Credential replaces complex addresses with verified user names: human-readable identifiers that map to a user\u2019s wallet. Mercuryo handles KYC onboarding and issuance, ensuring that aliases correspond to real, verified individuals.\n\nOnce verified, users can:\n\n* Link a self-custody wallet to a username-style alias\n* Receive assets using only that alias\n* Opt in to a soulbound credential on Polygon signaling their verified status across the Crypto Credential network\n\nThe result is a user-controlled wallet with a trusted, portable verification layer, without requiring users to give up custody, privacy, or flexibility.\n\nIt\u2019s a UX breakthrough: the simplicity of traditional payments with the self-custody of crypto.\n\n# A simple flow that feels like the internet\n\nExpanding Crypto Credential to self-custody unlocks a clean, universal user experience:\n\n1. Verify once with Mercuryo\n2. Get a username-style alias tied to your identity\n3. Link your self-custody wallet\n4. Optionally mint a soulbound credential signaling verification onchain\n5. Receive crypto via your alias (sending functionality next)\n\nNo more triple-checking hex strings. No more sending a test transaction and praying. Just a familiar flow users already understand.\n\nThis is a major shift in how people interact with blockchain. When verification becomes portable and UX becomes friendly, self-custody stops being a niche skill and starts becoming a default option.\n\n# Why Mastercard chose Polygon\n\nCrypto Credential requires infrastructure that behaves like a global payments network. That means:\n\n* Ease of integration for institutions\n* Reliability & trusted enterprise adoption\n* Sub-cent fees\n* Fast, predictable settlement\n* High throughput under real-world load\n* No reorg risk\n\nPolygon delivers exactly that.\n\nWith the recent Rio upgrade, the network eliminated the risk of reorgs and introduced stateless validation, lowering node costs to make building on Polygon easier than ever before. Combined with the Heimdall v2 consensus upgrade and higher throughput (with 5k TPS coming in the next few months), Polygon achieves near-instant finality, bringing faster settlement times than traditional payments systems.\n\nBillions in stablecoins already move across Polygon monthly, with neobanks, fintechs, and enterprise payment providers relying on the network for speed and reliability. Adding Mastercard Crypto Credential to self-custody workflows is a natural extension of this momentum.\n\nFor institutions, reliability is the differentiator. Polygon\u2019s architecture ensures transfers are final, fast, and cost-efficient, enabling credential verification flows to scale globally.\n\n# Adoption drives scale. Scale drives simplicity.\n\nMastercard\u2019s expansion onto Polygon is another signal in a broader pattern: global payments infrastructure is moving onchain, and Polygon is leading\n\nWhen money builders think about payments, they think about:\n\n* Reliability\n* Trust\n* Finality\n* Throughput\n* Cost efficiency\n\nEvery upgrade to Polygon is designed to enshrine these demands. Credential verification flows, high-frequency transfers, user onboarding, remittances, merchant payouts, and agentic payments all need a network that behaves like the internet.\n\nOn Polygon, they get it.\n\n# Build payments on Polygon\n\nWhether you\u2019re designing wallets, onboarding flows, identity layers, or full-scale payment applications, Polygon provides the speed, reliability, and real-world integrations to support global users.","449":"Sorry everyone.

Bitcoin does not work this way. \n\nPeople (I\u2019m people) like to say Bitcoin is currently acting as a store of value but some also seem to misunderstand that this doesn\u2019t guarantee the price of a bitcoin. \n\n**What actually matters is demand.** Unlike anything else in history we know what the supply of bitcoins will be. Exactly like everything else in history we **do not know** what the demand will be. \n\nAll we can do is assume others will eventually learn to understand why Bitcoin is so important and we can assume this will drive up demand for bitcoins. \n\nIn the past we have seen the \u201cfour year cycle\u201d or self fulfilling prophecy come true. But this is not some magical anomaly. It is people believing the prophecy and following it; instead of DCA into the network people are selling out of it. This causes the price of bitcoin to fall relative to other assets and currency. \n\nJust wanted to remind everyone of these things during this downturn. You can\u2019t predict human nature with accuracy but you can verify the supply of bitcoin. \n\nWith all that said, every single bear market has *coincidentally* front run a stock market correction. Every single stock market correction has front run a negative macroeconomic event (QT, major uncertainty, fear, etc). \n\nThis time is somewhat different from a macro perspective. The current fear is an AI bubble and the uncertainty is the Trump administration but rates are being cut and the \u201cmoney printer\u201d is almost certainly going into full swing.

That we would go into \"stocks like environment\" where we see smaller dips, but also smaller gains in coming bulls.\n\nNope.\n\n2026 is shaping up to be the most violent unwinding this space has ever experienced, and almost nobody is ready for it, as the general consensus from retail is the opposite atm.\n\nLet me explain why.  \n\n\n**1. Institutions don\u2019t hodl. They sell. And HARD they will sell.**\n\nThis cycle was the first time Bitcoin became a truly real institutional asset. Sounds bullish on paper, but the reality no one wants to talk about: institutions are forced sellers during recessions.\n\nThey de risk into cash.\n\nThey have clients to protect, redemptions to satisfy and risk rules to follow.\n\nThey are not your diamond handed Twitter influencers or average crypto bro from Reddit.\n\nWhen liquidity dries up, they don\u2019t wait for hopium. They hit the sell button.  \n\n\n**2. The MicroStrategy situation is a ticking bomb. BOMB**. **The \"Tsar bomba\" kind of a bomb.**\n\nEveryone treats MSTR like some \u201csavior of Bitcoin\u201d, but it is basically a publicly traded giga leveraged long BTC position. They have billions in debt and BTC as collateral. If BTC drops -40 to -50%, which it likely will, they get squeezed harder than crypto  gif memes.\n\nIf MSTR starts getting margin pressure or forced collateral adjustments, then the selling pressure will be worse than 3AC, Celsius and Terra combined. We will se a huge black swan event, similar or wose than the FTX event. However, this can be magnificant for retail to entry at low prices.   \n\n\n**3. ETF flows do not just go up.**\n\nYes. We had the first ETF driven bull run ever. But know what? That will follow with the first ETF driven bear run. If there is a recession or just a risk off macro period, ETF outflows will be brutal. Financial advisors will rotate clients into safer assets. Pension funds will reduce risk exposure. Family offices will trim BTC like any other volatile asset. When the lights go off for good (already starting), ETF outflows mean instant sell pressure that retail is not ready for.  \n\n\n**4. Corporate treasuries might have to dump too.**\n\nCompanies holding BTC look cool in a bull run, but when earnings weaken and credit conditions tighten.. Yeah, time to buckle up and say cya. It's natural for boards to tell them to cut risk. Auditors push impairment accounting. Cash becomes the thing again. Corporate selling has not been tested in a real macro downturn. 2026 WILL LIKELY be the first time.  \n\n\n**5. Leverage in this market is insane compared to previous cycles.**\n\nThe amount of perpetuals, options, structured BTC notes and corporate debt collateralized by BTC is ridiculous. When all of that unwinds under macro stress, it won\u2019t be a small minus -30% dip. It will be a face melting liquidity vacuum.  \n\n\n**6. QE will not save you early. It arrives after the pain.**\n\nLast but not least. Most people embrace the hopium of QE starting in 2026. Yes. Probably and actually, likely. But only after the market collapses. Q1-Q2 will be brutal. It will be enough time for the charts to plummet so hard it will go beneath your screen's bottom corner. Yes, after that will likely come QE, but why hold through that when one can sell now and double their position soon?\n\nThe next crash will not be (only) a retail emotional panic.\n\nIt will be an institutional, corporate, leverage driven purge.\n\n\n\nBTC survives. ETH probably survives. SOL might survive but bleed badly. Most altcoins will die and never come back. Many of the TOP 20 and even TOP 50 alts are already down -60% to -80% of their ATH prices. ADA going $0,02 or ALGO below $0,5 or ETH below $1000 are not unlikely scenarios. Some will drop even a lot more. Many big alts will be f\\*\\*d up so hard even their mother will not recognitze them.\n\nSo what I'm kinda trying to say.. If you think 2022 was bad, 2026 is going to surprise you.\n\nNot financial advice, btw.\n\nJust a warning from someone who finally stopped drinking hopium and started looking at the actual market structure we created.","609":"What happens when an inflationary economy meets the most deflationary technology ever created?

Instead of relying on hype cycles or inflationary supply models, a DAT ties a token to real revenue, real accumulation, and a clear economic framework.\n\nBONK\u2019s DAT is managed by Safety Shot, a publicly traded company. Safety Shot is the first public company to hold a memecoin as part of a formal treasury strategy. They currently hold about 2.75 percent of BONK\u2019s total supply and are actively growing toward a stated goal of 5 percent. Safety Shot receives 10 percent of revenue from BONKfun, and roughly 90 percent of that revenue is used for open market BONK accumulation.\n\nThis setup is unusual in the memecoin sector for three reasons.\n\n  \nFirst, BONK has an external buyer that is funded by product usage. As BONKfun grows, so does the revenue. As revenue grows, the DAT buys more BONK. This creates predictable demand that is linked directly to onchain activity.\n\n  \nSecond, Safety Shot is a public company. Public reporting requirements create stability and transparency that most memecoins do not have.\n\n  \nThird, it introduces a clear model for how cultural tokens can evolve. A memecoin with a revenue generating ecosystem and a corporate treasury that accumulates supply is fundamentally different from a token that relies on speculation alone.\n\nMost memecoins do not have a buyer of last resort, a recurring revenue source, or a structured treasury. BONK now has all three.\n\nFor a category that has historically struggled with durability, BONK\u2019s Digital Asset Treasury with Safety Shot may be one of the clearest paths toward a sustainable, long term memecoin economy.","660":"I want to understand crypto TPS, I think TPS is something most crypto networks tries to maximise right?\n\nFor example, Ethereum has a Max Theoretical TPS of 178.6 transactions per second, Solana has a Max Theoretical TPS of 65,000.

Each cycle has had diminishing returns, with significantly lower gains in the bull periods and slightly reduced losses in the bear periods.\n\nBased on this pattern we should expect BTC to be under $40K in October 2026, though of course there will be a choppy ride to get there.\n\nSome of the main reasons reality could turn out differently than this forecast:\n\n1. **We don't see reduced losses.**\u00a0I'm assuming the -77% we experienced in the last bear is part of a trend of reduced losses, implying about 70% drawdown this cycle. The low will be $22,500 if we see the historical average 82% drawdown.\n2. **Bear markets for stocks \/ recession.**\u00a0Since inception BTC has only existed during a historically positive bull market for US equities, with the exception of the COVID blip. A prolonged stock market bear or recession will probably result in a lower low than the table above.\n3. **Trump administration intervention.**\u00a0Trump and his circle are heavily exposed to crypto prices, and could try to intervene to keep prices from falling too much. This could result in a higher low than the four year cycle would predict.\n4. **The four year cycle is dead.**\u00a0There are a number of reasons this could be the case, and a predictable pattern can't last forever. For now it seems to be self fulfilling and very consistent so until the pattern breaks I'd be very careful betting against it.","664":"Friday there were rumors that Michael Saylor\u2019s company MSTR was selling btc he publicly announced they weren\u2019t selling but buying more, today he exposed that purchase.

I have reached a point where the current dip really doesn't change anything.

It doesn't matter if the value of the currency grows by 25-30 percent relative to some currency that doesn't solve any problem - or in fact - creates the problem.

Price goes up and go down. But last time I checked, I\u2019ve had the same Bitcoin I had a few months ago. \n\nDon\u2019t let these whales mess with you. It\u2019s what happens to ANY meaningful asset. Extremely wealthy people buy it and then they mess with the volatility. Everyone is buying bitcoin. Don\u2019t be the paper handed idiot that sells. I want the best for you.\n\nAll of my love. ","753":"Hi,\n\n  \nI'm wondering what btc investors consider the absolute bottom to be before they change their minds and agree that btc investment was\/is a bad idea. Maybe they wouldn't sell because it got so low that selling wouldn't bring any meaningful money back, but at least they would stop buying and believing it will go back to its all time high.\n\nThis is not meant as a provocative question, though it's on a btc sub, so please refrain from saying 'never', I'm really looking for as many answers as possible, to get a feeling of the average threshold everyone has.\n\nI'm sure that if btc were to drop to less than 1 dollar per btc, that the market cap likewise dropped to less than a few hundreds of million of dollars, and that the user base dropped to roughly a few thousand users, during an extended period of time (many years), most would at some point realize that btc hasn't delivered on its promises. \n\n**If you don't agree with the previous statement, please refrain from answering, because this question is not meant for you**.  \n  \nIf you do agree, it means you also believe there's a threshold, so I'm just asking what that threshold is. Ideally, please give as few criteria as possible (so, just btc in dollars, or just btc in dollars + period of time, so for example, \"I'd consider my btc investment a failure if it reached 10k \/ btc and stayed there for 5 consecutive years\"), so it's easy to compare the answers.\n\nAgain, I know many in this sub are just in the state of mind to hodl forever, whatever happens, and this question is not meant for these, it's meant for people that see btc as an investment and hope to get richer by investing in btc, and to see what their threshold is before they change their mind on that.\n\n\n\nThank you very much for reading, and hopefully answering.","754":"","755":"It looks enticing to buy In now but maybe it would drop to 80k first ?","756":"I see that Coinbase allows staking Bitcoin. It says that it stays in my own wallet and there is no risk but I can earn a passive income. I highly doubt that this is a self-custody wallet that it's talking about. The word staking means to me that it's at stake or at risk, so what exactly is it and is there any risk? The money is generated somehow of course.\n\nDoes this mean that I actually earn a percentage of Bitcoin back on the Bitcoin that is staked? I might consider staking about 10 percent of my stash.

I am a Bitcoin newbie, but I did my due diligence and feel very happy jumping in, even when my first purchase was at $115,000. I check the market for fun, but it doesn\u2019t stress me out.

","761":"Hello fellow Bitcoiners!\n\nIt\u2019s past midnight and I\u2019m sitting at my desk. I just felt this urge to share my perspective, so I pretty much threw this together straight from the top of my head.  \nPlease know that I originally wrote the text in very messy German, just quickly jotting down my thoughts. For a better reading experience, I had ChatGPT translate it into English without losing the character of my original writing.  \nHope you enjoy reading it and that it will help some of you in these times or cycle we are in! Because this was the intention.\n\nI would describe myself as an above-average compassionate and loving person. I picked up this personality trait in my early childhood, and back then it helped me keep my life together. But that\u2019s not supposed to be the topic here.  \nStill, this information matters, because I often think about how other people might be feeling and what they\u2019re going through \u2014 especially when they find themselves in a situation similar to one I\u2019ve already experienced.\n\nAnd that brings us to Bitcoin. I bought my first Bitcoin on July 24th, 2014 at 8:14 pm. At that time, I was studying computer science and had a bit of spare money as a student, and I just wanted to own it \u2014 and somehow understand it as well.  \nI paid \u20ac452.72 for it. To this day, I have never sold any of it, only bought more. I\u2019d like to share a bit about what those years were like for me so that new Bitcoiners can draw courage from it, not get distracted by all the snakes and leeches out there, and strengthen their feeling that they\u2019re believing in the right thing!\n\nEven though I studied computer science, I still didn\u2019t really know how Bitcoin actually works or why it\u2019s supposed to be good. There simply wasn\u2019t as much information back then as there is today. I told my father about the purchase and he laughed at me. He said, \u201cWell, play money\u2026 but don\u2019t buy any more of that crap.\u201d\n\nThen I went on a 10-month world trip because I had finished my studies and wanted to explore the world. When I returned in the summer of 2015, my Bitcoin was down 50%.  \nBack then I thought: \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t sell. Either it goes to zero or it recovers!\u201d\n\nIt took until May 29th, 2016 for Bitcoin to climb back to break-even. In the weeks after, it pumped to \u20ac715. Wow! Percentage-wise, better than my stock investments at the time \u2014 which wasn\u2019t hard, since I thought I\u2019d get rich with Chinese solar stocks, which went terribly wrong.\n\nBut the disappointment came right away \u2014 the entire gain was gone again within a few weeks!  \n\u201cDamn!!!!! I should\u2019ve sold, I could have had almost \u20ac300 profit\u2026\u201d  \nLook at the chart on Coinbase: that was on August 3rd, 2016, when I thought, \u201cYou greedy idiot, you should\u2019ve sold!\u201d\n\nBut everything turned out completely different. From there, the price climbed quickly to \u20ac1,000. I was euphoric \u2014 a real fireworks show! I had doubled my money, wow! And suddenly it went straight down again, and I didn\u2019t know whether I should exit or wait\u2026 would it turn around?! I really tore my hair out over it and decided to just let it run.\n\nWhen the price went back up and hit \u20ac2,000, my father said: \u201cCongratulations, my son!!! Insane. Sell now \u2014 it won\u2019t go any higher!\u201d  \nBack then, Bitcoin was framed in the news as the money of and for criminals. In the darknet people still used Bitcoin to buy drugs, weapons and other things. The press coverage was extremely negative and you got mocked from all sides. Really from\u00a0**ABSOLUTELY EVERY**\u00a0side.  \nCompared to today, you can\u2019t even imagine how unbelievably bad the conditions for Bitcoin were back then! Nobody knew it, and the few who did compared it to the tulip bubble.  \nAnd how stupid I must be not to just sell and take the money while I still could.\n\nWhy did I hold out and not sell?  \nAt some point I thought: okay, what if there really\u00a0*is*\u00a0something to this Bitcoin thing? Then I learned more and understood for the first time that Bitcoin is limited and decentralized, and that no company, group, or individual has direct power over BTC.\n\nI had always been a rebel. My school years were pure horror, my parents forced me to study, it was a lot of pressure. When I moved out, went to university and earned my own money, I learned to appreciate freedom. And the 10-month trip through Southeast Asia amplified that \u2014 I had never felt so free and self-determined!\n\nI realized that Bitcoin aligns much more with the values I stand for than fiat money, stocks, gold, etc. I liked the idea that everyone has the same chances and that \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is truly mine\u201d (assuming cold storage) and that Bitcoin cannot be inflated.\n\nSo I decided never to sell. \u201cEither it all goes to zero or it will change my life forever.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t imagine how hard my will was tested. I mean, look at the chart!!! Bitcoin went up to $20,000 \u2014 can you imagine how I felt?! WOW! Only to fall back down to $4,000 in the next bear market.  \nOf course I questioned everything again. Of course I told myself, \u201cYou greedy idiot, you should have sold! $20,000 \u2014 that would have been another 10-month world trip!\u201d\n\nBut then Bitcoin went up again! And seriously, try to put yourself in my shoes while looking at the chart. What a fucking rollercoaster ride!!!\n\nThe worst part for me was the dump from $69,000 down to $16,000. At that point I genuinely thought: okay, it\u2019s over now. The press was EXTREMELY negative, the words \u201cBitcoin ban\u201d were floating around, banks warned and demonized Bitcoin, and my dad said: \u201cWhat do you mean you didn\u2019t sell?! Are you crazy?!\u201d  \nAll the jealous people laughing behind their hands, convinced it would finally crash to zero.\n\nAnd my dream of freedom was gone! I was so devastated that I told myself: screw the $16,000, that won\u2019t change my life anyway. Sure, it would be a nice vacation, maybe a motorcycle, but I want to be free, damn it! I hate my IT job \u2014 the constant meetings, 30 days of vacation, 9-to-5 work. I can\u2019t stand it. (I should add that I earned very well \u2014 but I hated the job.)\n\nAgain, I decided not to sell and to stay in until Bitcoin goes to zero.\n\nWhen Bitcoin, to my total surprise, climbed back to $30k, I decided (again....) that I will\u00a0*never*\u00a0sell. I found it hard to believe that something so often pronounced dead could ever be killed, considering how resilient it keeps showing itself to be.  \nSo I started using my good salary to buy BTC from time to time.\n\nI bought Bitcoin at $26k, $40k, $50k, $60k, $80k, $90k, $100k, $110k, $120k.\n\nIf you\u2019re asking how I feel about the current correction:  \nI\u2019m insanely chill! The news couldn\u2019t be better. Seriously \u2014 states, pension funds, BlackRock ETF, Harvard, central banks\u2026 more and more are speaking in favor of BTC. What a\u00a0**BRUTAL**\u00a0difference compared to the old days.\n\nOf course it will remain volatile! It\u2019s the best store of value in human history, and people with huge wealth make a fortune from this volatility.\n\nTo all of you normal folks out there: I beg you sincerely \u2014 don\u2019t play this game and don\u2019t get confused by the noise. Buy Bitcoin and hold Bitcoin. That\u2019s all you need to do. And please don\u2019t drive yourselves crazy. I know how hard it is, and how easy it sounds when some anonymous internet dude like me says it.\n\nDo it like I did. Compare your own values with the values Bitcoin stands for. And then decide which side you want to be on. It will be worth it!\n\nI believe in a fairer and better world, and Bitcoin is the fair store of value for all of us.\n\nAll the best and let\u00b4s ride this together!\n\np.s. I quit my job 4 years ago and i live a free live. I will never work in IT again and i am now on my way to become a Personal Trainer, as Fitness, Nutrition and Health was always something I was interested about and loved doing.\n\n(Not financial advice. Just sharing my personal thoughts\/opinions on Bitcoin.)\n\nEdit:  \nWow so much feedback.  \nI decided to attach a screenshot of my first purchase, i keep it treasured with many other historic events regarding bitcoin :)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ydp86c8y1q1g1.png?width=2348&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cadc5729ebba8dc56142f9e1d64815c9b945a8f\n\nEdit2: Some additional thoughts added in a bottom comment for everyone who wants to read more","762":"","763":"Bitcoin keeps falling so why Altcoin season has started yet?

The dark blue area is coins <7d old; the warmer colors are older holders. Even as price grinds lower, \\~94% of the BTC spent here comes from coins younger than a week, with heavy realized losses. 30\u201390d coins are also locking in big losses. In contrast, 180d+ cohorts are a small share of volume and, when they do move, they\u2019re mostly realizing profits... not panic dumping.\n\nIn other words: this drawdown is being driven primarily by recent buyers and short-term traders puking coins at a loss, while long-term holders are barely flinching and selectively taking profit. That doesn\u2019t guarantee we\u2019ve found the floor, but on-chain it still looks more like a classic bull-market shakeout than full-cycle capitulation.","776":"","777":"There are thousands of central bank and government reps around the world defending fiat.

If this isn\u2019t a bottom signal, I don\u2019t know what is. I know technical analysis isn\u2019t 100% accurate, but historically an RSI of 30 or below combined with \u201cextreme fear\u201d on the Fear & Greed Index has *always* been a buy zone, not a sell zone.

Not long, I\u2019d guess.\n\n  \nLast time it was at this level was on 2022 dip at 22k, 2019 dip to 10 k and a 2018 dip to 6k. This is literally a historical reading of fear and greed index.

They had exchange volume and third party reports, and suddenly every flip from ETH to USDC and back looked like income until I could prove what was actually trading and what was just moving funds.\n\nNow I\u2019ve spent weekends living inside Etherscan and old wallets, trying to rebuild cost basis for trades I barely remember, just to show I wasn\u2019t some profit god, I was mostly spinning my wheels and paying gas.

Haven\u2019t went short yet but I think very soon I\u2019m thinking about it. It doesn\u2019t make sense to be starting a bear market in extreme fear really and we never did get into the euphoria stage of the market. I think institutions have really changed things a lot.

I wonder if others feel the same.\n\n\\- I'd say this dip is caused by unsophisticated investors who believe that prices should follow predictable four year cycles, which is financial nonsense. Assets are efficiently priced and if they followed predictable schedules everyone would be a trillionaire. Ironically, because many people seem to believe it, there may be a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy going on, but because these people are selling to front run a 2026 bear market, that bear market may actually already be over before 2026 hits, causing current sellers to lose out on gains.\n\n\\- Bitcoin is probably closer to putting in a bottom than most people think. Sentiment is rotten and I have to suspect most people who plan on selling will have sold by now.\n\n\\- Altz did not put in convincing new highs and will probably never recover. Unlike Bitcoin, they do not have the credible decentralisation and network effects that are required to be considered a neutral form of money. Also, their techonological promises have turned out to be BS, with the possible exception of stablecoins. Though stablecoins could actually run perfectly fine on a permissioned blockchain as they are a centralised asset anyway. When the four year cycle is revealed to be nonsense, that's it for altz.\n\nMy guess: we'll see a short, shallow bear market caused by unsophisticated sellers and 2026 will actually be a big up year. Bottom may actually be in coming weeks.","799":"Dip Dive","800":"I find the endless posts of cycles, charts - and bait such as \u201cRandom person X believes BTC will be worth $250,000 next year\u201d exhausting.\n\nI look at my holdings the same way as shares and such - long term hold for a gain.

","817":"","818":"# One of the most visible shifts in recent years is the quiet transformation of what it means to be human inside a civilization. For a long time, a person\u2019s entire destiny was anchored to their point of birth\u2014nationality, family, identity, institutions, culture, language. These were not labels; they were the outer shell that defined your coordinates in the world. They told you who you were allowed to be and silently informed you of the boundaries you could never cross. It was a complete structure, and most people lived their entire lives inside it without ever questioning its shape.\n\nBut as the world moves deeper into higher complexity, that outer shell has begun to loosen. More and more of your real agency no longer depends on where you were born, but on **how** you are connected. It\u2019s no longer about belonging to a place, but about being readable by a global system. Your capabilities, opportunities, and even your trajectory are starting to be determined less by geography and more by the networks you plug into. Identity is gradually shifting from something assigned to something discovered.\n\nThis shift isn\u2019t philosophical. It\u2019s structural.\n\nAs civilization transitions from a geographic architecture to a networked one, a human being naturally transitions from a geographic identity to a network identity. The more you observe the deep trends, the clearer it becomes: the \u201csovereign individual\u201d is not an idea people believe in\u2014it is the shape the future demands. It is a functional outcome of how a more complex world must operate.\n\nIn the old world, the nation was the primary unit and the person was the smallest one.  \nIn the emerging world, the network is the primary unit and the node is the smallest one.\n\nFor the first time, an individual can exist like a node\u2014independent, verifiable, portable, autonomous, able to operate across borders, and not tied to any specific institution. This isn't empowerment; it\u2019s a redesign of the human interface.\n\nA person is beginning to be treated less like a citizen of a location and more like an object the system can authenticate: a set of keys, a trail of on-chain proofs, a collection of digital assets, a history of interactions. Credit becomes something you prove yourself, not something handed down by institutions. Value becomes something you generate inside networks, not something assigned by organizations. Your boundary shifts from where your body lives to the systems you participate in.\n\nThis transformation is profound precisely because no one needs to promote it and no one can stop it. It arises naturally from the metabolism of a civilization facing more complexity than its old architecture can handle.\n\nWhen systems grow too large, authority naturally decentralizes.  \nWhen coordination becomes too difficult, power naturally distributes.  \nWhen institutions can no longer guarantee coherence, trust migrates to protocols.  \nWhen geography limits opportunity, identity migrates to networks.  \nWhen the old world loses functionality, the new one grows underneath it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t ideology\u2014it\u2019s the physics of complex systems.\n\nYou can think of the future as a \u201cself-declared civilization\u201d where individuals don\u2019t wait for recognition from institutions; they demonstrate who they are to the system itself. You no longer need a nation to validate you, because the new infrastructure allows you to validate yourself. Once identity becomes verifiable, assets portable, reputation recordable, and value globally accessible, a person can finally detach from the old shell without losing coherence.\n\nThe sovereign individual is not someone trying to escape the state.  \nIt is someone given an additional layer of existence.  \nNot outside civilization, but parallel to it.  \nNot rejecting the old world, but no longer confined to it.\n\nThe future individual will exist like an API\u2014readable, trustworthy, collaborative, portable.  \nIdentity will no longer be a single binding; it will be a multi-chain presence.  \nDestiny will no longer be defined by institutions; it will be shaped by the networks you choose.  \nFreedom will no longer be a granted permission; it will be an interoperability feature.\n\nThose who understand this shift early will move first\u2014not by abandoning their countries, but by acquiring a new dimension of identity. Not by rejecting society, but by gaining a second space to operate from.\n\nCivilization is rewriting the definition of a person, not to fulfill an ideal, but to solve the scale of the world it is becoming. The sovereign individual is not a rebel or a visionary\u2014it is simply the kind of human the next civilization needs.\n\nAnd we just happen to be alive as this transition begins.","819":"","820":"","821":"","822":"","823":"I started late at 115k ish.

If you see posts on the front page or \/r\/Bitcoin\/new which are better suited for this daily discussion thread, please help out by directing the OP to this thread instead. Thank you!\n\nIf you don't get an answer to your question, you can try phrasing it differently or commenting again tomorrow.\n\nPlease check the [previous discussion thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/1oxk89k\/daily_discussion_november_15_2025\/) for unanswered questions.","870":"I'm a CFA Charterholder working in banking. The more I look at Bitcoin, the more convinced I am that its core premises are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how money, risk, and the economy actually work. This is a risk asset, full stop. Not a hedge.\n\nThe 21 million cap is treated as gospel, but it's economically disastrous for a currency. In a growing economy (more goods, services, and people), a fixed money supply means prices must constantly fall (deflation). This crushes economic growth. Why would anyone spend or invest today when their money is guaranteed to be worth more tomorrow just by holding it? It encourages hoarding, not commerce. It also makes simple concepts like getting a raise a nightmare. For your employer to give you a raise in real terms, they would have to pay you less Bitcoin as its purchasing power rises. For one person to gain, another must lose. It creates a parasitic, zero-sum mindset instead of a growth-oriented one.\n\nThe \"inflation hedge\" argument is often based on a high-school-level reading of the Quantity Theory of Money (MV=PQ). The idea that an increase in Money Supply (M) directly causes an increase in Prices (P) is a wild oversimplification. This theory only holds if the Velocity of Money (V) and real GDP (Q) are constant. In the real world, they are not. Velocity has been in a structural decline for decades. Central banks don't manage the supply of money; they manage the price of money (interest rates) to target inflation (prices). Bitcoin's \"fixed supply\" is a rigid solution to a problem that is far more dynamic and complex.\n\nBitcoin's core value prop is eliminating the middleman. This is a bug, not a feature. A third party (a bank, a credit card company) is an asset to the financial system. They provide essential consumer protections like fraud resolution, transaction reversal, and chargebacks for services not rendered. In a trustless, irreversible system, \"Not your keys, not your coins\" also means \"Your mistake, your total loss.\" If you get scammed, send funds to the wrong address, or have your wallet drained, you have zero recourse. The main beneficiaries of a system with no middleman are criminals.\n\nThe original whitepaper title was \"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\" The community pivoted to \"Digital Gold\" because Bitcoin failed miserably at being cash. The proof is stablecoins. If Bitcoin was the perfect settlement asset, why is the entire crypto-economy built on stablecoins? The crypto world itself runs on USD-backed tokens (USDT, USDC). This is a clear signal that even crypto users will not tolerate a volatile asset for transactions. The bull counter is that the Lightning Network makes it fast. But the volatility is the problem, not just the speed. No merchant will accept a payment that could be worth 5% less by the time they settle their books. No business will expose itself to that speculative risk.\n\nBitcoiners argue the \"TradFi\" system is slow and archaic. This was true. But that delay was often a feature, not a bug, it generated \"float revenue\" for banks. Crypto lit a fire under the industry. Now we have SWIFT GPI (Nearly 60% of international payments are credited in under 30 minutes) and real-time payment networks (FedNow in the US, NPP in Australia, etc.). The real long-term digital strategy isn't a decentralized, volatile asset. It's Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). These will be centralized, regulated, and stable. The existing financial system will simply pivot to be the interlinking network for this new system.\n\nTo sum it up: Crypto doesn't solve a problem that traditional banking can't (and isn't already) solving itself.\n\nTL;DR: Bitcoin is a high-risk, speculative asset. It is not an inflation hedge, it's not a currency, and its fixed-supply economic model is fundamentally flawed.\n\n\u00a0","871":"","872":"Anyone know about this?

It looks more like a massive, persistent system\u2014structured, algorithmic, and eerily consistent across individuals and cultures.\n\nFrom this vantage point, \u201clife\u201d feels less like free exploration and more like entering a giant open-world game where you spend decades completing quests, gaining XP through pain, exchanging resources, and unlocking new areas based on your stats.\n\nWe\u2019re told that our lives are shaped by our country, our education, or our personal choices. But behind all those layers, there\u2019s something deeper at work:\n\na civilization-level operating system.\n\nAnd most people run on it without ever noticing the interface.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n1. People live inside nations, but they operate inside systems\n\nWe usually interpret our lives through the lens of politics, society, and culture.\nBut if you look past the surface, you\u2019ll notice something else:\n\nMost of a person\u2019s \u201cfreedom\u201d is actually the output of a larger structural logic.\n\nThings like:\n\t\u2022\tYour social mobility\n\t\u2022\tYour opportunities\n\t\u2022\tYour emotional responses\n\t\u2022\tYour sense of meaning\n\t\u2022\tEven your \u201cpersonal decisions\u201d\n\nall follow patterns that are too consistent to be purely individual.\n\nIn other words:\nyou\u2019re not just living your life\u2014you\u2019re executing a system\u2019s scripts.\n\nNot because someone wrote them for you,\nbut because that\u2019s how large-scale civilizations evolve.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. Civilization has base stats, just like a game\n\nIf an RPG has STR, INT, VIT, and CHA,\nthen modern human life runs on four comparable stats:\n\nPhysical capacity, mental stability, cognitive models, and social influence.\n\nThese four attributes quietly determine:\n\t\u2022\tHow far you can go\n\t\u2022\tWhat paths you can see\n\t\u2022\tHow you react to uncertainty\n\t\u2022\tHow much the world \u201cpushes back\u201d\n\t\u2022\tWhat level of complexity you can handle\n\nPeople think hard work is the whole story.\nBut hard work is just one modifier applied on top of much larger variables.\n\nCivilization doesn\u2019t care about your intentions;\nit only reads your parameters.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. The old world ran on two engines: the Dollar and the Value System\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the real \u201csource code\u201d of modern civilization, it\u2019s not kings, territory, or ideology.\n\nIt\u2019s two things:\n\n1. The U.S. Dollar \u2014 the global energy distribution engine\n2. The Western value framework \u2014 the global meaning and order engine\n\nThe dollar decides:\n\t\u2022\twhere capital flows\n\t\u2022\thow resources are priced\n\t\u2022\twhich countries rise or fall\n\t\u2022\twhat technologies get funded\n\nThe value system decides:\n\t\u2022\tlaw\n\t\u2022\tmorality\n\t\u2022\tfamily structure\n\t\u2022\tpolitical norms\n\t\u2022\tideas of success and legitimacy\n\nFor about 70 years, these two engines synchronized perfectly.\n\nThat era is ending.\n\nNot because of politics,\nbut because all complex systems eventually hit the limits of their architecture.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. The signs of an aging civilization system\n\nOld systems don\u2019t collapse overnight.\nThey fade.\n\nYou see it in things like:\n\t\u2022\tdeclining trust\n\t\u2022\tfractured identity\n\t\u2022\tinconsistent rules\n\t\u2022\toverextended debt-based growth\n\t\u2022\tinstitutions that can\u2019t keep up with technology\n\t\u2022\tconflicting value systems\n\t\u2022\tpeople feeling \u201clost\u201d despite material abundance\n\nThese aren\u2019t random crises.\nThey\u2019re symptoms of a system reaching the end of its scaling curve.\n\nCivilization is not breaking;\nit\u2019s outgrowing its software.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5.

It used to be that when bitcoin cratered, there would be depressing memes about going back to work at mcds and the imfamous hotline number but this time is different. I see more posts about buying more, holding the line and getting those discounts. \n\n  \nWe are reaching the end of a debt cycle. A long and brutal one that began in the ashes of 2009 when rates were cut to near zero. It happened again just in time during the pandemic, breathing a little more life into the bubble. Now we are reaching the end. The debt is maturing in the next 2 years and when it comes due, it will take the rest of the market with it. UNLESS rates are cut. Loans will be refinanced and we will keep plotting along as everything slowly falls apart. Both outcomes are good for bitcoin. In the first, we will see the price of bitcoin absolutely crater. It will be a disaster. The over leveraged financial institutions will sell up to save their own asses. So you buy more. You acquire what they couldn't afford. Eventually things will settle. Prices come down, the economy deflates and has some horrible GDP numbers for a few years but eventually it all starts over again. Maybe this time will be different (new defi, digital currencies whatever who knows). But it will end the same. The credit starts flowing, the banks get hungry, prices go up, bitcoin goes up. Scenario two is a little different. We decide we don't want to pop the bubble just yet. We need MORE. Rates drop to near zero quickly, money flows in, the price of bitcoin barely settles before going up and up as the dollar goes down down. \n\n  \nEither way you can't really lose. The fundamentals of btc never change. There will always be a set amount released, we know how much and when. The dollar will always play games so every cycle will play out the same.
