In my evenings I\u2019ve now built up a full website, built the back end, ordered in the first 100 bears and started to market to family \/ friends.\n\nThe concept is that people can choose how much bitcoin they load the bear with and can scan the QR code on the back of the bear to check the balance at any time.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest the solution is very much MVP and I expect it to raise a few eyebrows on here but also don\u2019t want to sink too much time and money into something until I can prove the concept.\n\nCurrently I hold a pooled wallet and release the bitcoin manually on unlock date. I know I need to make the custody more robust in the long term but feel like this gives me a good starting point for the first 100 bears and did just start as me creating something for my own nephew!\n\nI\u2019d be really keen to share what I\u2019ve built and get some feedback from fellow bitcoiners on:\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The concept itself (would you gift it?!)\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The website, branding and user journey\n\nc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any thoughts on longer term custody model and ways to build trust\n\nOpen to all thoughts and feedback!

On several platforms that offer P2P, the price to buy USDT with euros is consistently lower than the price to sell USDT back to euros. Normally in any market the buy price (what you pay) is higher than the sell price (what you receive), so this inverted spread surprised me.\n\nWas it always like this in the euro P2P market? Is it something temporary caused by liquidity issues, local demand, or maybe regulations affecting European fiat ramps?

I'm pretty sure online casinos aren't allowed where he's from so it caught my eye. Turns out they don't require kyc, you literally just sign up with an email and you\u2019re good to go. I had to use a vpn too because it's blocked where I am but they don't actually verify any of your details when you sign up.\n\n\n\nI figured I\u2019d try it out since I\u2019ve been looking for a crypto casino that wasn\u2019t a headache to sign up for. Been messing around on there the past couple weeks and it looks kinda like Stake. Plus they\u2019ve got daily\/weekly\/monthly bonuses, random chests that drop while you\u2019re playing, and a $20k weekly raffle just for betting.\n\n\n\nThe cool part is deposits and withdrawals are straight crypto, so you don\u2019t need to mess around with bank details. I've withdrawn straight to Binance a bunch now and it normally hits in under 10 minutes. I was worried early on that they'd try and do kyc or ban my account if I won big but I've wagered over a mil in volume now (ik I'm a bit of a degen) and haven't had issues even with big withdrawals.\n\n\n\nJust thought I'd share for anyone who's wanted to try out a crypto casino but can't where they are. I'm pretty sure you can get massive deposit bonuses if you live in a region where crypto casinos are available and actually do their kyc but if you can't do it they still give you a 72 hour 20% rakeback bonus if you use a promo link.

Instead of relying on hype cycles or inflationary supply models, a DAT ties a token to real revenue, real accumulation, and a clear economic framework.\n\nBONK\u2019s DAT is managed by Safety Shot, a publicly traded company. Safety Shot is the first public company to hold a memecoin as part of a formal treasury strategy. They currently hold about 2.75 percent of BONK\u2019s total supply and are actively growing toward a stated goal of 5 percent. Safety Shot receives 10 percent of revenue from BONKfun, and roughly 90 percent of that revenue is used for open market BONK accumulation.\n\nThis setup is unusual in the memecoin sector for three reasons.\n\n  \nFirst, BONK has an external buyer that is funded by product usage. As BONKfun grows, so does the revenue. As revenue grows, the DAT buys more BONK. This creates predictable demand that is linked directly to onchain activity.\n\n  \nSecond, Safety Shot is a public company. Public reporting requirements create stability and transparency that most memecoins do not have.\n\n  \nThird, it introduces a clear model for how cultural tokens can evolve. A memecoin with a revenue generating ecosystem and a corporate treasury that accumulates supply is fundamentally different from a token that relies on speculation alone.\n\nMost memecoins do not have a buyer of last resort, a recurring revenue source, or a structured treasury. BONK now has all three.\n\nFor a category that has historically struggled with durability, BONK\u2019s Digital Asset Treasury with Safety Shot may be one of the clearest paths toward a sustainable, long term memecoin economy.","45":"I want to understand crypto TPS, I think TPS is something most crypto networks tries to maximise right?\n\nFor example, Ethereum has a Max Theoretical TPS of 178.6 transactions per second, Solana has a Max Theoretical TPS of 65,000.

Each cycle has had diminishing returns, with significantly lower gains in the bull periods and slightly reduced losses in the bear periods.\n\nBased on this pattern we should expect BTC to be under $40K in October 2026, though of course there will be a choppy ride to get there.\n\nSome of the main reasons reality could turn out differently than this forecast:\n\n1. **We don't see reduced losses.**\u00a0I'm assuming the -77% we experienced in the last bear is part of a trend of reduced losses, implying about 70% drawdown this cycle. The low will be $22,500 if we see the historical average 82% drawdown.\n2. **Bear markets for stocks \/ recession.**\u00a0Since inception BTC has only existed during a historically positive bull market for US equities, with the exception of the COVID blip. A prolonged stock market bear or recession will probably result in a lower low than the table above.\n3. **Trump administration intervention.**\u00a0Trump and his circle are heavily exposed to crypto prices, and could try to intervene to keep prices from falling too much. This could result in a higher low than the four year cycle would predict.\n4. **The four year cycle is dead.**\u00a0There are a number of reasons this could be the case, and a predictable pattern can't last forever. For now it seems to be self fulfilling and very consistent so until the pattern breaks I'd be very careful betting against it.","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"UPDATE FOR LUCKYFOOL BITCOIN BANKNOTE:\n\nNotes are in and keys built.

In short - I have been holding Bitcoin since the end of 2011. To date, I have not sold my Bitcoin, and I have no intention of selling it in the near future. Luckily, I have a fairly large amount of fiat and a good job (which I enjoy doing) so that I can be about my life right now without having to sell my Bitcoin. I will just share my self-reflection from the current dip and the development I went through with myself. I remember Christmas 7 or 8 years ago, when I thought that maybe the end had indeed come. The depression, the crisis and the lack of faith in humanity... Since then, there have been a few more dips that I remember. And with each dip, my faith in the currency seems to be stronger. I have reached a point where the current dip really doesn't change anything. Of course, if in two or three years there is no growth in demand and use of Bitcoin - then this could reflect something negative.  But the bottom line is - Bitcoin solves an existing problem of inflation. Bitcoin is here to stay. It doesn't matter if the value of the currency grows by 25-30 percent relative to some currency that doesn't solve any problem - or in fact - creates the problem. So, friends, you - the one who holds Bitcoin - are the ones striving for a better reality.

","147":"Hello fellow Bitcoiners!\n\nIt\u2019s past midnight and I\u2019m sitting at my desk. I just felt this urge to share my perspective, so I pretty much threw this together straight from the top of my head.  \nPlease know that I originally wrote the text in very messy German, just quickly jotting down my thoughts. For a better reading experience, I had ChatGPT translate it into English without losing the character of my original writing.  \nHope you enjoy reading it and that it will help some of you in these times or cycle we are in! Because this was the intention.\n\nI would describe myself as an above-average compassionate and loving person. I picked up this personality trait in my early childhood, and back then it helped me keep my life together. But that\u2019s not supposed to be the topic here.  \nStill, this information matters, because I often think about how other people might be feeling and what they\u2019re going through \u2014 especially when they find themselves in a situation similar to one I\u2019ve already experienced.\n\nAnd that brings us to Bitcoin. I bought my first Bitcoin on July 24th, 2014 at 8:14 pm. At that time, I was studying computer science and had a bit of spare money as a student, and I just wanted to own it \u2014 and somehow understand it as well.  \nI paid \u20ac452.72 for it. To this day, I have never sold any of it, only bought more. I\u2019d like to share a bit about what those years were like for me so that new Bitcoiners can draw courage from it, not get distracted by all the snakes and leeches out there, and strengthen their feeling that they\u2019re believing in the right thing!\n\nEven though I studied computer science, I still didn\u2019t really know how Bitcoin actually works or why it\u2019s supposed to be good. There simply wasn\u2019t as much information back then as there is today. I told my father about the purchase and he laughed at me. He said, \u201cWell, play money\u2026 but don\u2019t buy any more of that crap.\u201d\n\nThen I went on a 10-month world trip because I had finished my studies and wanted to explore the world. When I returned in the summer of 2015, my Bitcoin was down 50%.  \nBack then I thought: \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t sell. Either it goes to zero or it recovers!\u201d\n\nIt took until May 29th, 2016 for Bitcoin to climb back to break-even. In the weeks after, it pumped to \u20ac715. Wow! Percentage-wise, better than my stock investments at the time \u2014 which wasn\u2019t hard, since I thought I\u2019d get rich with Chinese solar stocks, which went terribly wrong.\n\nBut the disappointment came right away \u2014 the entire gain was gone again within a few weeks!  \n\u201cDamn!!!!! I should\u2019ve sold, I could have had almost \u20ac300 profit\u2026\u201d  \nLook at the chart on Coinbase: that was on August 3rd, 2016, when I thought, \u201cYou greedy idiot, you should\u2019ve sold!\u201d\n\nBut everything turned out completely different. From there, the price climbed quickly to \u20ac1,000. I was euphoric \u2014 a real fireworks show! I had doubled my money, wow! And suddenly it went straight down again, and I didn\u2019t know whether I should exit or wait\u2026 would it turn around?! I really tore my hair out over it and decided to just let it run.\n\nWhen the price went back up and hit \u20ac2,000, my father said: \u201cCongratulations, my son!!! Insane. Sell now \u2014 it won\u2019t go any higher!\u201d  \nBack then, Bitcoin was framed in the news as the money of and for criminals. In the darknet people still used Bitcoin to buy drugs, weapons and other things. The press coverage was extremely negative and you got mocked from all sides. Really from\u00a0**ABSOLUTELY EVERY**\u00a0side.  \nCompared to today, you can\u2019t even imagine how unbelievably bad the conditions for Bitcoin were back then! Nobody knew it, and the few who did compared it to the tulip bubble.  \nAnd how stupid I must be not to just sell and take the money while I still could.\n\nWhy did I hold out and not sell?  \nAt some point I thought: okay, what if there really\u00a0*is*\u00a0something to this Bitcoin thing? Then I learned more and understood for the first time that Bitcoin is limited and decentralized, and that no company, group, or individual has direct power over BTC.\n\nI had always been a rebel. My school years were pure horror, my parents forced me to study, it was a lot of pressure. When I moved out, went to university and earned my own money, I learned to appreciate freedom. And the 10-month trip through Southeast Asia amplified that \u2014 I had never felt so free and self-determined!\n\nI realized that Bitcoin aligns much more with the values I stand for than fiat money, stocks, gold, etc. I liked the idea that everyone has the same chances and that \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is truly mine\u201d (assuming cold storage) and that Bitcoin cannot be inflated.\n\nSo I decided never to sell. \u201cEither it all goes to zero or it will change my life forever.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t imagine how hard my will was tested. I mean, look at the chart!!! Bitcoin went up to $20,000 \u2014 can you imagine how I felt?! WOW! Only to fall back down to $4,000 in the next bear market.  \nOf course I questioned everything again. Of course I told myself, \u201cYou greedy idiot, you should have sold! $20,000 \u2014 that would have been another 10-month world trip!\u201d\n\nBut then Bitcoin went up again! And seriously, try to put yourself in my shoes while looking at the chart. What a fucking rollercoaster ride!!!\n\nThe worst part for me was the dump from $69,000 down to $16,000. At that point I genuinely thought: okay, it\u2019s over now. The press was EXTREMELY negative, the words \u201cBitcoin ban\u201d were floating around, banks warned and demonized Bitcoin, and my dad said: \u201cWhat do you mean you didn\u2019t sell?! Are you crazy?!\u201d  \nAll the jealous people laughing behind their hands, convinced it would finally crash to zero.\n\nAnd my dream of freedom was gone! I was so devastated that I told myself: screw the $16,000, that won\u2019t change my life anyway. Sure, it would be a nice vacation, maybe a motorcycle, but I want to be free, damn it! I hate my IT job \u2014 the constant meetings, 30 days of vacation, 9-to-5 work. I can\u2019t stand it. (I should add that I earned very well \u2014 but I hated the job.)\n\nAgain, I decided not to sell and to stay in until Bitcoin goes to zero.\n\nWhen Bitcoin, to my total surprise, climbed back to $30k, I decided (again....) that I will\u00a0*never*\u00a0sell. I found it hard to believe that something so often pronounced dead could ever be killed, considering how resilient it keeps showing itself to be.  \nSo I started using my good salary to buy BTC from time to time.\n\nI bought Bitcoin at $26k, $40k, $50k, $60k, $80k, $90k, $100k, $110k, $120k.\n\nIf you\u2019re asking how I feel about the current correction:  \nI\u2019m insanely chill! The news couldn\u2019t be better. Seriously \u2014 states, pension funds, BlackRock ETF, Harvard, central banks\u2026 more and more are speaking in favor of BTC. What a\u00a0**BRUTAL**\u00a0difference compared to the old days.\n\nOf course it will remain volatile! It\u2019s the best store of value in human history, and people with huge wealth make a fortune from this volatility.\n\nTo all of you normal folks out there: I beg you sincerely \u2014 don\u2019t play this game and don\u2019t get confused by the noise. Buy Bitcoin and hold Bitcoin. That\u2019s all you need to do. And please don\u2019t drive yourselves crazy. I know how hard it is, and how easy it sounds when some anonymous internet dude like me says it.\n\nDo it like I did. Compare your own values with the values Bitcoin stands for. And then decide which side you want to be on. It will be worth it!\n\nI believe in a fairer and better world, and Bitcoin is the fair store of value for all of us.\n\nAll the best and let\u00b4s ride this together!\n\np.s. I quit my job 4 years ago and i live a free live. I will never work in IT again and i am now on my way to become a Personal Trainer, as Fitness, Nutrition and Health was always something I was interested about and loved doing.\n\n(Not financial advice.

The dark blue area is coins <7d old; the warmer colors are older holders. Even as price grinds lower, \\~94% of the BTC spent here comes from coins younger than a week, with heavy realized losses. 30\u201390d coins are also locking in big losses. In contrast, 180d+ cohorts are a small share of volume and, when they do move, they\u2019re mostly realizing profits... not panic dumping.\n\nIn other words: this drawdown is being driven primarily by recent buyers and short-term traders puking coins at a loss, while long-term holders are barely flinching and selectively taking profit. That doesn\u2019t guarantee we\u2019ve found the floor, but on-chain it still looks more like a classic bull-market shakeout than full-cycle capitulation.","161":"","162":"There are thousands of central bank and government reps around the world defending fiat.

I wonder if others feel the same.\n\n\\- I'd say this dip is caused by unsophisticated investors who believe that prices should follow predictable four year cycles, which is financial nonsense. Assets are efficiently priced and if they followed predictable schedules everyone would be a trillionaire. Ironically, because many people seem to believe it, there may be a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy going on, but because these people are selling to front run a 2026 bear market, that bear market may actually already be over before 2026 hits, causing current sellers to lose out on gains.\n\n\\- Bitcoin is probably closer to putting in a bottom than most people think. Sentiment is rotten and I have to suspect most people who plan on selling will have sold by now.\n\n\\- Altz did not put in convincing new highs and will probably never recover. Unlike Bitcoin, they do not have the credible decentralisation and network effects that are required to be considered a neutral form of money. Also, their techonological promises have turned out to be BS, with the possible exception of stablecoins. Though stablecoins could actually run perfectly fine on a permissioned blockchain as they are a centralised asset anyway. When the four year cycle is revealed to be nonsense, that's it for altz.\n\nMy guess: we'll see a short, shallow bear market caused by unsophisticated sellers and 2026 will actually be a big up year. Bottom may actually be in coming weeks.","183":"Dip Dive","184":"I find the endless posts of cycles, charts - and bait such as \u201cRandom person X believes BTC will be worth $250,000 next year\u201d exhausting.\n\nI look at my holdings the same way as shares and such - long term hold for a gain.

","201":"","202":"# One of the most visible shifts in recent years is the quiet transformation of what it means to be human inside a civilization. For a long time, a person\u2019s entire destiny was anchored to their point of birth\u2014nationality, family, identity, institutions, culture, language. These were not labels; they were the outer shell that defined your coordinates in the world. They told you who you were allowed to be and silently informed you of the boundaries you could never cross. It was a complete structure, and most people lived their entire lives inside it without ever questioning its shape.\n\nBut as the world moves deeper into higher complexity, that outer shell has begun to loosen. More and more of your real agency no longer depends on where you were born, but on **how** you are connected. It\u2019s no longer about belonging to a place, but about being readable by a global system. Your capabilities, opportunities, and even your trajectory are starting to be determined less by geography and more by the networks you plug into. Identity is gradually shifting from something assigned to something discovered.\n\nThis shift isn\u2019t philosophical. It\u2019s structural.\n\nAs civilization transitions from a geographic architecture to a networked one, a human being naturally transitions from a geographic identity to a network identity. The more you observe the deep trends, the clearer it becomes: the \u201csovereign individual\u201d is not an idea people believe in\u2014it is the shape the future demands. It is a functional outcome of how a more complex world must operate.\n\nIn the old world, the nation was the primary unit and the person was the smallest one.  \nIn the emerging world, the network is the primary unit and the node is the smallest one.\n\nFor the first time, an individual can exist like a node\u2014independent, verifiable, portable, autonomous, able to operate across borders, and not tied to any specific institution. This isn't empowerment; it\u2019s a redesign of the human interface.\n\nA person is beginning to be treated less like a citizen of a location and more like an object the system can authenticate: a set of keys, a trail of on-chain proofs, a collection of digital assets, a history of interactions. Credit becomes something you prove yourself, not something handed down by institutions. Value becomes something you generate inside networks, not something assigned by organizations. Your boundary shifts from where your body lives to the systems you participate in.\n\nThis transformation is profound precisely because no one needs to promote it and no one can stop it. It arises naturally from the metabolism of a civilization facing more complexity than its old architecture can handle.\n\nWhen systems grow too large, authority naturally decentralizes.  \nWhen coordination becomes too difficult, power naturally distributes.  \nWhen institutions can no longer guarantee coherence, trust migrates to protocols.  \nWhen geography limits opportunity, identity migrates to networks.  \nWhen the old world loses functionality, the new one grows underneath it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t ideology\u2014it\u2019s the physics of complex systems.\n\nYou can think of the future as a \u201cself-declared civilization\u201d where individuals don\u2019t wait for recognition from institutions; they demonstrate who they are to the system itself. You no longer need a nation to validate you, because the new infrastructure allows you to validate yourself. Once identity becomes verifiable, assets portable, reputation recordable, and value globally accessible, a person can finally detach from the old shell without losing coherence.\n\nThe sovereign individual is not someone trying to escape the state.  \nIt is someone given an additional layer of existence.  \nNot outside civilization, but parallel to it.  \nNot rejecting the old world, but no longer confined to it.\n\nThe future individual will exist like an API\u2014readable, trustworthy, collaborative, portable.  \nIdentity will no longer be a single binding; it will be a multi-chain presence.  \nDestiny will no longer be defined by institutions; it will be shaped by the networks you choose.  \nFreedom will no longer be a granted permission; it will be an interoperability feature.\n\nThose who understand this shift early will move first\u2014not by abandoning their countries, but by acquiring a new dimension of identity. Not by rejecting society, but by gaining a second space to operate from.\n\nCivilization is rewriting the definition of a person, not to fulfill an ideal, but to solve the scale of the world it is becoming. The sovereign individual is not a rebel or a visionary\u2014it is simply the kind of human the next civilization needs.\n\nAnd we just happen to be alive as this transition begins.","203":"","204":"","205":"","206":"","207":"I started late at 115k ish.

Exhibit 6 breaks down a 51% attack\u2019s potential inputs based on Exhibit 3\u2019s cost-of-mining analysis and assumes the instant availability of mining machines, which is, of course, unrealistic. Hardware is the largest expenditure, about $4.6 billion at current prices. The data center build would require $1.34 billion and electricity to run the hardware and maintain the data center about $0.13 billion per week.* ***All told, a one-week attack would cost about $6 billion, or 0.26% of the bitcoin network\u2019s total value****.

The more I look at Bitcoin, the more convinced I am that its core premises are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how money, risk, and the economy actually work. This is a risk asset, full stop. Not a hedge.\n\nThe 21 million cap is treated as gospel, but it's economically disastrous for a currency. In a growing economy (more goods, services, and people), a fixed money supply means prices must constantly fall (deflation). This crushes economic growth. Why would anyone spend or invest today when their money is guaranteed to be worth more tomorrow just by holding it? It encourages hoarding, not commerce. It also makes simple concepts like getting a raise a nightmare. For your employer to give you a raise in real terms, they would have to pay you less Bitcoin as its purchasing power rises. For one person to gain, another must lose. It creates a parasitic, zero-sum mindset instead of a growth-oriented one.\n\nThe \"inflation hedge\" argument is often based on a high-school-level reading of the Quantity Theory of Money (MV=PQ). The idea that an increase in Money Supply (M) directly causes an increase in Prices (P) is a wild oversimplification. This theory only holds if the Velocity of Money (V) and real GDP (Q) are constant. In the real world, they are not. Velocity has been in a structural decline for decades. Central banks don't manage the supply of money; they manage the price of money (interest rates) to target inflation (prices). Bitcoin's \"fixed supply\" is a rigid solution to a problem that is far more dynamic and complex.\n\nBitcoin's core value prop is eliminating the middleman. This is a bug, not a feature. A third party (a bank, a credit card company) is an asset to the financial system. They provide essential consumer protections like fraud resolution, transaction reversal, and chargebacks for services not rendered. In a trustless, irreversible system, \"Not your keys, not your coins\" also means \"Your mistake, your total loss.\" If you get scammed, send funds to the wrong address, or have your wallet drained, you have zero recourse. The main beneficiaries of a system with no middleman are criminals.\n\nThe original whitepaper title was \"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\" The community pivoted to \"Digital Gold\" because Bitcoin failed miserably at being cash. The proof is stablecoins. If Bitcoin was the perfect settlement asset, why is the entire crypto-economy built on stablecoins? The crypto world itself runs on USD-backed tokens (USDT, USDC). This is a clear signal that even crypto users will not tolerate a volatile asset for transactions. The bull counter is that the Lightning Network makes it fast. But the volatility is the problem, not just the speed. No merchant will accept a payment that could be worth 5% less by the time they settle their books. No business will expose itself to that speculative risk.\n\nBitcoiners argue the \"TradFi\" system is slow and archaic. This was true. But that delay was often a feature, not a bug, it generated \"float revenue\" for banks. Crypto lit a fire under the industry. Now we have SWIFT GPI (Nearly 60% of international payments are credited in under 30 minutes) and real-time payment networks (FedNow in the US, NPP in Australia, etc.). The real long-term digital strategy isn't a decentralized, volatile asset. It's Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). These will be centralized, regulated, and stable. The existing financial system will simply pivot to be the interlinking network for this new system.\n\nTo sum it up: Crypto doesn't solve a problem that traditional banking can't (and isn't already) solving itself.\n\nTL;DR: Bitcoin is a high-risk, speculative asset. It is not an inflation hedge, it's not a currency, and its fixed-supply economic model is fundamentally flawed.\n\n\u00a0","255":"","256":"Anyone know about this?

People live inside nations, but they operate inside systems\n\nWe usually interpret our lives through the lens of politics, society, and culture.\nBut if you look past the surface, you\u2019ll notice something else:\n\nMost of a person\u2019s \u201cfreedom\u201d is actually the output of a larger structural logic.\n\nThings like:\n\t\u2022\tYour social mobility\n\t\u2022\tYour opportunities\n\t\u2022\tYour emotional responses\n\t\u2022\tYour sense of meaning\n\t\u2022\tEven your \u201cpersonal decisions\u201d\n\nall follow patterns that are too consistent to be purely individual.\n\nIn other words:\nyou\u2019re not just living your life\u2014you\u2019re executing a system\u2019s scripts.\n\nNot because someone wrote them for you,\nbut because that\u2019s how large-scale civilizations evolve.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. Civilization has base stats, just like a game\n\nIf an RPG has STR, INT, VIT, and CHA,\nthen modern human life runs on four comparable stats:\n\nPhysical capacity, mental stability, cognitive models, and social influence.\n\nThese four attributes quietly determine:\n\t\u2022\tHow far you can go\n\t\u2022\tWhat paths you can see\n\t\u2022\tHow you react to uncertainty\n\t\u2022\tHow much the world \u201cpushes back\u201d\n\t\u2022\tWhat level of complexity you can handle\n\nPeople think hard work is the whole story.\nBut hard work is just one modifier applied on top of much larger variables.\n\nCivilization doesn\u2019t care about your intentions;\nit only reads your parameters.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. The old world ran on two engines: the Dollar and the Value System\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the real \u201csource code\u201d of modern civilization, it\u2019s not kings, territory, or ideology.\n\nIt\u2019s two things:\n\n1. The U.S. Dollar \u2014 the global energy distribution engine\n2. The Western value framework \u2014 the global meaning and order engine\n\nThe dollar decides:\n\t\u2022\twhere capital flows\n\t\u2022\thow resources are priced\n\t\u2022\twhich countries rise or fall\n\t\u2022\twhat technologies get funded\n\nThe value system decides:\n\t\u2022\tlaw\n\t\u2022\tmorality\n\t\u2022\tfamily structure\n\t\u2022\tpolitical norms\n\t\u2022\tideas of success and legitimacy\n\nFor about 70 years, these two engines synchronized perfectly.\n\nThat era is ending.\n\nNot because of politics,\nbut because all complex systems eventually hit the limits of their architecture.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. The signs of an aging civilization system\n\nOld systems don\u2019t collapse overnight.\nThey fade.\n\nYou see it in things like:\n\t\u2022\tdeclining trust\n\t\u2022\tfractured identity\n\t\u2022\tinconsistent rules\n\t\u2022\toverextended debt-based growth\n\t\u2022\tinstitutions that can\u2019t keep up with technology\n\t\u2022\tconflicting value systems\n\t\u2022\tpeople feeling \u201clost\u201d despite material abundance\n\nThese aren\u2019t random crises.\nThey\u2019re symptoms of a system reaching the end of its scaling curve.\n\nCivilization is not breaking;\nit\u2019s outgrowing its software.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5. AI and blockchains are emerging as replacement engines\n\nThis isn\u2019t hype\u2014it\u2019s structural inevitability.\n\nAI solves the problem of \u201ccomplexity beyond human management.\u201d\nIt becomes the new intelligence layer of civilization.\n\nBlockchains solve the problem of \u201ctrust without central authority.\u201d\nThey become the new order layer of civilization.\n\nOne replaces the cognitive bottleneck,\nthe other replaces the institutional bottleneck.\n\nTogether they form:\n\na new operating system for a new kind of civilization.\n\nWe are witnessing the handoff from old rules to new protocols.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n6. The individual is shifting from \u201ccitizen\u201d \u2192 \u201csovereign actor\u201d\n\nFor most of history, your identity was tied to:\n\t\u2022\tbirthplace\n\t\u2022\tethnicity\n\t\u2022\tclass\n\t\u2022\tinstitution\n\t\u2022\tnational systems\n\nBut digital life is erasing those boundaries.\nYour value is increasingly determined by:\n\t\u2022\tyour skills\n\t\u2022\tyour network\n\t\u2022\tyour digital footprint\n\t\u2022\tyour ability to plug into global systems\n\t\u2022\tyour capacity to navigate complexity\n\nThe center of gravity is shifting from nation-defined humans\nto network-defined humans.\n\nThis is the early stage of a major civilizational transition.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n7. We\u2019re not watching the world end; we\u2019re watching its software update\n\nCivilizational transitions don\u2019t announce themselves.\nThey don\u2019t come with fireworks or manifestos.\n\nThey look exactly like what we\u2019re experiencing now:\n\t\u2022\told systems quietly losing coherence\n\t\u2022\tnew systems quietly gaining traction\n\t\u2022\tconfusion at the edges\n\t\u2022\topportunity in the cracks\n\t\u2022\tindividuals suddenly able to do things once exclusive to states\n\nWe aren\u2019t collapsing.\nWe\u2019re migrating.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nPeople think they\u2019re living their personal lives.\nBut at a deeper level, they\u2019re participating in a once-in-a-century system upgrade.\n\nAnd for those paying attention,\nthe upgrade screen is already visible.","266":"","267":"Sometimes when the market gets noisy, I just go back and read the Bitcoin whitepaper again and again.

It used to be that when bitcoin cratered, there would be depressing memes about going back to work at mcds and the imfamous hotline number but this time is different. I see more posts about buying more, holding the line and getting those discounts. \n\n  \nWe are reaching the end of a debt cycle. A long and brutal one that began in the ashes of 2009 when rates were cut to near zero. It happened again just in time during the pandemic, breathing a little more life into the bubble. Now we are reaching the end. The debt is maturing in the next 2 years and when it comes due, it will take the rest of the market with it. UNLESS rates are cut. Loans will be refinanced and we will keep plotting along as everything slowly falls apart. Both outcomes are good for bitcoin. In the first, we will see the price of bitcoin absolutely crater. It will be a disaster. The over leveraged financial institutions will sell up to save their own asses. So you buy more. You acquire what they couldn't afford. Eventually things will settle. Prices come down, the economy deflates and has some horrible GDP numbers for a few years but eventually it all starts over again. Maybe this time will be different (new defi, digital currencies whatever who knows). But it will end the same. The credit starts flowing, the banks get hungry, prices go up, bitcoin goes up. Scenario two is a little different. We decide we don't want to pop the bubble just yet. We need MORE. Rates drop to near zero quickly, money flows in, the price of bitcoin barely settles before going up and up as the dollar goes down down. \n\n  \nEither way you can't really lose. The fundamentals of btc never change. There will always be a set amount released, we know how much and when. The dollar will always play games so every cycle will play out the same.

I just want to share the concept and get community thoughts on the model itself.\n\n**What it actually is:**\n\nIt's basically a way for people to experiment with mining without buying hardware. Users pick a coin, pick a small package (from tiny 3-hour ones to larger rentals), and the mining is done using rented rigs from external marketplaces. The platform itself doesn't hold any mined coins, payouts go directly from the pool to the user\u2019s wallet.\n\n**Why I built it:**\n\nI noticed a lot of people are interested in mining but don't want to deal with:\n\n* high hardware costs\n* noise\/heat\n* electricity issues\n* setup\/config\n* maintaining miners So I thought a simple \u201cclick, mine, done\u201d interface could make the whole experience more accessible.\n\n**How it works behind the scenes:**\n\n* It sources hashrate from existing rig-rental networks\n* Coins include BTC, LTC, DOGE, KAS, BCH, RVN, XMR, and others\n* The goal is to make it cheap to try, some rentals are just a few dollars\n* Results depend entirely on the network difficulty and luck (especially solo mining)\n* The platform earns a small margin between rental cost and package price\n* There's no token, no investment scheme, no staking, and no promises of returns\n\n**Why I'm sharing this here:**\n\nI know mining discussions here often split into:\n\n* \u201cDIY or nothing\u201d\n* \u201cCloud mining is a scam\u201d So I'd genuinely like honest feedback about this *SaaS-rental* model. It's transparent, doesn't promise profit, and doesn't act as a custodian, but I'd love to hear how the wider community views this kind of platform.\n\n**Do you see value in lowering the barrier to mining?**  \nOr does the community prefer sticking to hardware-based setups?\n\nHappy to answer *general* questions about the model.\n\nThanks!","474":"\nShout out to Bitcoin Dad for sharing the wisdom.

Many feel it\u2019s due for a significant correction\u2014or even a full-blown crash. Meanwhile, Bitcoin seems to be going through changes as well. Longtime members of the community often say it\u2019s not what it used to be, with new investors panicking over 20% drops and large financial institutions showing off holdings in ways that feel like clear market manipulation\u2014especially in recent months with all the pump-and-dump activity.\n\nI recently watched a video where a financial advisor made a point I found interesting: the stock market measures how the wealthy are doing, while the economy measures how the average blue-collar worker is doing. Looking at both, it seems like the wealthy are growing exponentially, while the middle class is disappearing.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m curious about:\n\t\u2022\tDo you think Bitcoin will ever return the kind of gains it once did?\n\t\u2022\tIs the stock market actually overvalued, or are we just witnessing the rich getting richer while the rest of us struggle?\n\t\u2022\tIs this the \u201cnew America,\u201d where the middle class has effectively vanished?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your practical takes\u2014no hype, just real perspectives.\n\nYes, I used AI to help me put this together, but these are my thoughts.","850":"I'm talking about firms like MSTR.

I'm a beginner and I'm planning to get a Trezor Safe 7 soon. I've been thinking about good security management and would like you to review\/expand my idea for potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nI'm grateful for any feedback, so thank you in advance for taking the time! Hard wallet model: Trezor Safe 7 (Bitcoin-only version)\n\n\n\nStructure summary:\n\n\n\nTrezor Safe 7 Standard Wallet (24 words) | Trade Account: This wallet is used to process all external transactions, e.g., receiving payments from\/to third parties, or deposits\/withdrawals at cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n\n\nTrezor Safe 7 Passphrase Wallet (25 words) | Hold Account: This wallet is solely for storing Bitcoin. No external transactions are permitted, neither receiving nor sending Bitcoin. The only allowed transactions are sending and receiving funds to\/from the trade account.\n\n\n\nAll funds to be sent or received must go through the trading account. Upon receiving funds, they are transferred from the trading account to the holding account.\n\n\n\nHere, I would also use a passphrase that I definitely cannot remember and keep separately on a metal plate in a separate location, not where my seed phrase is stored, to prevent theft of both the seed phrase and the passphrase.\n\n\n\nStoring the passphrase separately has the advantage for me that I can never move assets from the holding account at short notice, as I would first have to travel to another location to retrieve them, since the passphrase is required to authorize payments. This limits the usability of my holding account, but I actually prefer that, as I don't plan to access my holdings for at least 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nStoring the passphrase separately has the advantage for me that I can never move assets from the holding account at short notice, as I would first have to travel to another location to retrieve them, since the passphrase is required to authorize payments. This limits the usability of my holding account, but I actually find that beneficial, as I don't plan to access my holdings for at least 10 years.\n\n\n\nAdditional Security Measures:\n\n\n\n\\- Only enter the passphrase using Trezor Safe 7 during account creation to prevent compromise on the computer during entry (e.g., keyloggers).\n\n\n\nGeneral Security Rules:\n\n\n\n\\- Never store the seed phrase digitally (no digital notes or photos, such as \"keep your key offline\").\n\n\n\n\\- Store the seed phrase in metal (likely using Trezor Keep Metal) and keep the passphrase securely stored, but in a different location than the seed phrase.\n\n\n\n\\- Never share the public key (XPUB) to prevent all account activity from being traced.\n\n\n\nI put a lot of effort into writing this, and perhaps it will be helpful to others. You would greatly appreciate it if you would take the time to review my structure and share any suggestions for improvement or report any security vulnerabilities.","892":"Warren Buffett has argued that Bitcoin isn\u2019t an investment but a gamble, because it produces no cash flow.

Fortunately, more and more people are beginning to see that\u2014especially in countries suffering from high inflation, where Bitcoin isn\u2019t a luxury but a basic necessity for anyone with savings.  \nBottom line: Coca-Cola is a gamble; Bitcoin is money.  \nI don\u2019t claim to understand investments, but I do care about saving for the future \u2014 and common sense tells me to do that using a currency with a built-in supply limit.","893":"Never let go","894":"","895":"Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m looking to buy some Bitcoin (BTC) through peer-to-peer (P2P) methods instead of going through regular exchanges.

This is getting geopolitical fast.\n\nThe Bitcoin was originally stolen from Chinas LuBian mining pool back in December 2020. At the time it was worth about 3.5 billion but the hack did not get much mainstream attention. The coins then sat in the attacker\u2019s wallets for years and only started moving in mid 2024 before ending up in addresses that analysts and China\u2019s report now link to US authorities, and that the DOJ says it controls as of the seizure announced in October 2025.\n\nChinas argument is that normal criminals would cash out immediately. The fact these coins stayed dormant for about four years points to a state level operation not some random hacker looking for quick profit. They say the sophistication of the hack and the long dormancy proves it was government orchestrated.\n\nThe US Department of Justice seized the Bitcoin in October 2025 as part of a case against Chen Zhi who ran Cambodias Prince Group. They charged him with running a massive crypto fraud and forced labor scam network and said the seizure was a lawful criminal proceeds forfeiture. The DOJ has explicitly denied China\u2019s \u201cstate level hack\u201d accusation and says it had no involvement in the original theft.\n\nHeres the thing tho. Chen Zhi apparently sent multiple messages on chain basically begging the hackers to return the Bitcoin and offering ransom. The hackers never responded which is weird if they were just criminals.\n\nThis batch of Bitcoin now represents about 39% of all BTC held by the US government based on on chain tracking of US controlled addresses. Trump recently said the US is far ahead of China in crypto adoption so this accusation comes at a politically charged moment.\n\nWhether China has real evidence or this is just geopolitical posturing nobody knows yet.

The decision stemmed from a public tweet where he expressed interest in hedging his position, which violated the project's strict ICO terms.\n\nSo this will be confusing as the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is similar to the influencer\u2019s name (icobeast). I will do my best to refer to the influencer with his full name. \n\nFor background on the ICO: MegaETH's public token sale ran from October 28 to October 31, 2025, offering 500 million MEGA tokens, which was 5% of the total 10 billion supply, at a valuation that attracted over $1.4 billion in commitments for just $50 million worth of tokens, resulting in a staggering 28x oversubscription. Icobeast, a well-known figure in the space for his airdrop farming guides, reviews of projects, and history of securing large allocations in high-profile launches, was awarded a significant portion valued at approximately $1 million based on pre-market pricing.\n\nThe terms of the ICO were clear and uncompromising: Participants agreed to a one-year lock-up period on their tokens, with explicit prohibitions against any form of hedging, shorting, or over-the-counter (OTC) trading. Additionally, the agreement barred public statements on social media or elsewhere discussing intentions to sell, hedge, or otherwise mitigate risk, as these could undermine the project's goal of fostering long-term commitment from holders rather than short-term speculators.\n\nThe trigger was icobeast\u2019s tweet on November 9, 2025: \u201cAt current pre-market prices my MegaETH ICO allocation is worth nearly $1 million dollars. I need to figure out how to hedge this.\u201d The post went viral within crypto circles, amassing thousands of likes and replies debating the ethics of such transparency. Less than 24 hours later, icobeast followed up with: \u201cMy allocation has been revoked and is now worth $0,\u201d confirming that MegaETH had enforced the clause by issuing a full refund and reallocating the tokens to other eligible participants.\n\nThis isn't the first sign of MegaETH's rigorous approach. MegaETH has emphasized building a \"real-time\" blockchain ecosystem free from the dump-and-run dynamics that plague many token launches. By revoking the allocation, they aimed to preserve scarcity and align incentives with genuine builders and users.\n\nMegaETH tried to incorporate social scoring and reputation metrics like Ethos into its ICO allocation process to prioritize \"conviction\" over speculation. Allocations in the \"Conviction Round\" were determined algorithmically using onchain activity, wallet age, lock-up commitments, and reputation signals from platforms like Ethos and Kaito, alongside NFT holdings in the MegaETH ecosystem such as Fluffle and Bad Bunnz.\n\nEthos, a decentralized reputation protocol, assigns trust scores based on on-chain behavior, social contributions, and community feedback, categorizing users as \"trusted,\" \"neutral,\" or \"untrusted.\" MegaETH weighted these scores alongside other data to filter for long-term holders, enforcing a one-year lock-up, no-hedging policy, and bans on public discussions of selling or risk mitigation.\n\nicobeast entered with a high Ethos score reflecting positive on-chain engagement and social influence. This earned him an initial allocation valued at nearly $1 million at pre-market prices, positioning him as a top recipient under the system's metrics.\n\nIn stark contrast, influencer KookCapitalLLC, who\u2019s known for rugging her followers, received a 94% allocation on her maximum $186,282 bid. This netted her $174,490 to purchase 1,746,644 MEGA tokens. Her Ethos score sits at 357, firmly in the \"untrusted\" tier, stemming from documented patterns of high-volume sales post-hype and public disputes, including rejecting KOL deals and score manipulation allegations.\n\nThis has become become super controversial as some praised MegaETH for upholding rules in an oversubscribed sale, others pointed out how a high-reputation participant with a clean Ethos profile loses out over a hypothetical statement, while a low-score figure with a history of alleged follower dumps secures whale status.\n\nYet another tale of crypto drama \n","945":"","946":"Hi I am trying to buy uscr and I dont fully trust phantom can I buy this on coinbase?

For 8 years two branches of Bitcoin exist and tick along: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. As I was watching it unfold for pretty long time, I held assumptions that right now I deem as mistakes. And also for the longest time when I was asked about Bitcoin, I was descrining its strengths a bit different than I do now. Let me articulate some thoughts\n\nBiggest strength for what? I argue: for savings. From the dawn of the Internet I used a lot of payment systems, and some of the solutions that exist right now satisfy my requirements for payments almost completely, most of them are centralized and some are not like BCH. So, having thought carefully about it recently, I am not in agreement anymore with many BCH proponents (and with Satoshi) that payments is the core of open blockchain tech that was created in 2009 or even a bigger part of it. Satoshi was addressing bailouts in Genesis block, also he put then and most of the people put since very big emphasis on supply limit\n\n**Biggest strength of Bitcoin is its specific digital nature**. It has several characteristics that puts it over fiat, physical or digial, gold (and other metals) and tokens of other chains launched after Bitcoin\n\nThose are, in concentric circles:\n\n* supply cap and nature of mining - puts it over fiat, limit and who gets new coins\n\n* digitalness, incospicousness, multisignability - puts it over gold - ease of crossing borders, of resisting govt aggression, of storing savings in an invisible manner, of trustlessly locking funds, the pathway to a world with little-to-no-theft of savings\n\n* energy signature and network effect - puts it over all PoW chains and all non-PoW chains - in case of contention I can fallback to heaviest chain instead of choosing whom to trust on social media (BCH is steaily losing ground here for now as it gets relatively lighter and lighter vs BTC as BCH slowly loses in network effect zero-sum game). Bitcoin is most decentralized and most secure that it has every beeng: most efficient mining machines most closely distributed to global capital, ~800 equivalent PoW days of billions worth of hardware - measure of security\n\n**Biggest problem in Bitcoin is the secure management of private keys**, Not fess in USD equivalent. For the longest time I was missing it, but now more carefully looked at on-chain numbers of both chains: fork dot lol, coin dot dance, bitinfocharts dot com and others - I think I was wrong back then. Both BTC and BCH are heavily custodied not for some conspiratorial reasons, but because massed of people who are flocking to crypto to save purchasing power from inflation can't or don't want to figure out key management - so they voluntarily reintroduce 3rd party trust and risks back in\n\nSo, BCH hasn't solved biggest problem. Not back at the fork, not in years still. I like ASERT and ABLA, clever dynamic metrics are much better than some constants. I like that fractional satoshis and quantum-proof signing are being discussed at BitcoinCashResearch. These two are indeed most dangerous among most discusesed technical problems remaining. I don't care much about smart contracts (as I deem payments issues are red-herring and, not unlikely - way to sell unbaked ideas to VCs) - I don't place high urgenty on improving on-chain math on BCH or elsewhere. But BCH did nothing to address management of keys\n\nIn principal it could be solved with: software, hardware or networks. I don't see hardware wallets as the solution: a device is not inconspicous, could provide false sense of security if mishandled (google IronKey 8 attempts out of 10), approach has bad trust model (trusting the manufacturer, worse if a natural monopoly with economies of scale will appear) and still singlesign as most realized. Singlesign puts everything on the line at specific points: malware or user mistake - and coins are gone (contracts only worsen the risk model). I am not smart enough to imagine a software solution\n\nSo. my **call to action** to address the biggest problem in Bitcoin is to demand from the market (especially from current cryptobanks): shift from singlesign 3rd party custody to multisging 3rd party custody. Say, client prepares address with a cryptobank and an escrow and funds it after, then coins only could be spent 2-of-3 when 1 of 2 is the client's key (plus timelocks, plus all clever stuff etc). Rare careful transactions of managing savings - much like managing stock papers through brokers or going to a bank in old days, but with all benefits of multisging. As I see it this could more or less eliminate theft of savings by private or state criminals alike\n\nI think that insisting that BCH is better than BTC purely on fees and would switch to BCH happen that everyone would live happily ever after - misses this problem, and could be in itself part of the reason BCH is losing its network effect. And BTC proponents are having their inconsequaential beef right now. Both communities (public forums, Reddit\/BitcoinTalk\/X\/Telegram) are blinded and\/or confused, so to speak\n\nI self-custody. I use coin control. I use all iterations of money tech: fiat, metals, crypto - for risk management and for various goals. I don't expect majority to be like me.

And then even that answer got down votes.\n\nThere are still lots of people that just hate the fact that someone brings up the crypto question.

Soon after, those people were replaced my the machines that not only can do the work faster and better, they cost a fraction of what a person was paid. As a result, those angry workers formed a union and started breaking into the factories at night, and breaking down the machines. In some case setting up fire. Eventually some of them were hanged and a decade later, the machines replaced workers.

The fact these coins stayed dormant for about four years points to a state level operation not some random hacker looking for quick profit. They say the sophistication of the hack and the long dormancy proves it was government orchestrated.\n\nThe US Department of Justice seized the Bitcoin in October 2025 as part of a case against Chen Zhi who ran Cambodias Prince Group.

The DOJ has explicitly denied China\u2019s \u201cstate level hack\u201d accusation and says it had no involvement in the original theft.\n\nHeres the thing tho.

I think Zcash maybe could rise bcs of Grayscale but it seemed that DASH just followed the up trend before\n\nThey try everything to keep the market controlled and also they are afraid of loosing the monitoring about people in general - I don't think it's only about the \"bad\" people.","992":"","993":"It's been said many times before, but now it's official: the EU isn't fighting financial crime. It's fighting financial freedom.\n\nYou've probably already heard that starting 2027, the new AML rules will make it illegal to use more than \u20ac10K in cash, and you'll need to show ID for anything over \u20ac3K. They're calling it \"anti\u2013money laundering\". I call it what it really is - the slow suffocation of privacy, disguised as protection.\n\nCash is being phased out, step by step, in the name of \"security\". The timing isn't random either - the Digital Euro is next, and it's coming around 2029. Christine Lagarde and the ECB want you to believe it's about \"innovation\" and \"efficiency\". Right... only, programmable money means programmable control. It means every cent you spend will be logged, filtered and analyzed. It means one flick of a switch could freeze your funds if you say, buy or donate to the \"wrong\" thing.\n\nAnd here's the part nobody's really talking about - because it hasn't made the headlines yet. Once the Digital Euro and the Digital ID system (the EUDI Wallet) are fully rolled out, you'll need your verified Digital ID to buy or hold Bitcoin legally on any EU-compliant exchange. That's baked into MiCA, TFR and eIDAS 2.0 or in short - No ID, no Bitcoin.\n\nThey can't ban BTC outright - that would wake too many people up. So instead, they'll lock it behind KYC walls, tie your wallet to your identity and make \"unregistered\" transactions suspicious by default. You'll \"own\" Bitcoin, but only through their system; verified through their wallet; Approved by their standards; Logged in their database - all under the illusion of safety and compliance.\n\nThis is why the time to stack is now. Before the walls go up. Before \"non-compliant wallets\" become a red flag. Before the Digital Euro becomes your default wallet - whether you like it or not. Once the Digital Euro replaces physical cash, Bitcoin will be the only truly free money left. It's the only network that doesn't care about passports, permissions or delusional policies.\n\nIf you're in Europe, this is your warning shot. The choice isn't between fiat and crypto anymore - it's between freedom and obedience. Once money becomes a monitoring tool, you'll never get that privacy back.\n\nSo stack while you still can. Stack quietly. Be smart about where and how you grow your holdings - for example if you keep it on N\u0435\u0445\u043e, you'll earn yield on idle BTC while accumulating, then move to self-custody when the time's right. Every extra sat counts when you're stacking against a system designed to box you in.\n\nWhen the new rules kick in and they announce that you'll need your \u201cverified Digital ID\u201d to buy Bitcoin, remember this moment. The EU wants to own you... And Bitcoin is your last exit before the gate closes!","994":"I've been stacking since 2020 and have what i would consider to be a lifetime worth of sats through mostly KYC means, but i do have a smaller stash of no-KYC sats that i got through robosats almost 4 years ago.\n\nI am considering switching over to no-KYC from this point forward so that the state cannot tie my identity to my Bitcoin. I am worried that fiat will have huge issues in the next decade and would like to protect myself from state attacks. \n\nAnyone share the same mindset or have any experiences doing so?\n\nI am planning to use my own node on electrum server, coin control the UTXOs, and use robosats over TOR browser. ","995":"","996":"The infamous \"Uptober Fk up\" was a brutal gut-check. Instead of the expected rally, October 2025 broke a seven-year bullish streak, triggering a flash crash and a massive wave of liquidations that sent prices tumbling from all-time highs of over $126,000 to dip below the $100,000 psychological barrier. This panic-selling washed out huge amounts of leverage and shattered retail confidence, pushing the market into \"Extreme Fear.\"  \nSo why buy now? Because this is precisely the kind of capitulation that long-term bulls look for.\nThis wasn't a fundamental failure of the network; it was a technical, leverage-driven shakeout. The core arguments for Bitcoin remain unchanged. We're seeing institutional investors hold steady, refusing to panic-sell. The recent dip was a stress test, and the $100k level, while breached, has shown significant psychological and technical support.\nNow, with the excessive leverage cleared, the market has reset. We are seeing the price reclaim key technical levels, like the 50-week moving average, a classic sign of a trend re-establishing itself. The macro-environment, with ongoing government stimulus talks and inflationary pressures, continues to build the case for a scarce, hard asset.\nThe \"Fk up\" provided a steep discount, shaking out the \"paper hands\" and leaving a stronger foundation. Buying after a massive panic, when others are fearful, is the classic high-conviction move. The weak hands have folded; the smart money is accumulating. This is the dip.","997":"","998":"Would like to set up weekly DCA buys.
